# Letter from the Chairman

Dear Shareholder,

In FY 2024, your company has continued to deliver strong performance. I am pleased to share with you that your company has crossed annual revenues of ₹240,893 crore, a growth of 6.8%, over the previous year. With relentless focus on operational excellence, this growth has come at an industry leading operating margin of 24.6%*, an increase from 24.1% last year. The order book for FY 2024 came at an all-time high of US$ 42.7 billion supported by strong client relationships and engagement. Client metrics continue to exhibit healthy progress with strong client additions. Employee retention continues to be at benchmark levels in the industry. TCS has been selected as a Top Employer of Choice in 32 countries. TCS has retained its ranking as the second most valuable global IT services brand, valued at US$19.2 billion, an increase of US$2 billion from last year.

The global environment around the world continues to go through significant shifts. Post the pandemic, which resulted in supply chain shocks, there was an economic slowdown especially in developed markets. While initial signs of stability began to emerge, the military conflicts have further intensified this year and continue to impact the global supply chains.

- GenAI technologies will impact almost every sector and country going forward. Enterprises have already invested in cloud, data infrastructure and large processing power which will aid AI/ GenAI. GenAI will not only improve productivity, but also create impact we hitherto have not seen or imagined.
- Global energy transition is accelerating, and businesses are making clear commitments towards a sustainable future. The energy requirement of our fast-changing world is enormous. Key is to lower the cost of energy while also transitioning to renewables. This transition requires large investment in technology, electric mobility, renewable power, hydrogen and sustainable fuel.

Letter from the Chairman

Geo-political challenges are continuing to alter established supply chains and companies are rebalancing their supply chains to address both resilience and efficiency. New global supply chain ecosystems are being created, with India playing an important role in advanced manufacturing.

Advanced manufacturing, new technologies like AI, new energy, data and business models are changing the future of work and are compelling new skillsets to be built for the future.

Secure networks have become a key necessity as data is the foundation for businesses of today. These networks power everything from predictive analytics and AI to personalized customer experiences. As value of data increases, along with concerns of privacy and protection, it has rightly become a focal point of security for all businesses.

The key question is what these disruptions mean to the IT services industry and how your company is preparing for these? As enterprises globally prepare to respond to these mega trends, we see multiple opportunities for your company. Every industry is embracing these trends and their business is being shaped for the future. For example:

- The deployment of AI and GenAI will significantly help financial institutions in both driving efficiency as well as target new customers and serve customers in a very personalized manner. For example, Insurance claims will be processed in a matter of minutes, lending and disbursements will become much faster.
- Adoption of new energy solutions and AI technology is driving the future of automobiles. It is not only driving reduction of emissions but also providing a new level of customer experience.
- AI is accelerating drug development by screening millions of compounds, predicting interactions and generating new candidates for testing.
- Connected medical devices together with AI and GenAI will transform Healthcare in a significant way. It will enhance productivity, enable remote care and help overcome shortage of skilled resources.
- In Advanced manufacturing, an AI-first approach will drive new benchmarks in productivity, efficiency and sustainability.

These transitions will require substantial investment in technology across industry sectors. Your company is making significant investments and building capabilities to partner with customers during this phase of rapid technological shifts:

- In FY 2024, TCS has consolidated AI and Cloud expertise with the creation of the AI.Cloud unit. In addition, each of the business groups are developing domain-specific AI/GenAI offerings relevant to the industry value chain. Over 300,000 employees have been upskilled on GenAI technologies in FY 2024. TCS’ products and services are also being enhanced with AI capabilities. For example, TCS BaNCSᵀᴹ is enriching its product portfolio with integrated AI/ML and GenAI capabilities; AI is also being embedded in Cybersecurity services to enable predictive capabilities.
- To partner with customers on their energy transition agenda, TCS is investing in research on green hydrogen, biofuels; developing digital platforms to help customers reduce Scope 1/2/3 emissions. Our proprietary ESG framework enables enterprises to build transparency into operations and simplifies compliance reporting.
- TCS is pioneering the engineering of the 5G/6G communication stacks using open standards. Two state-of-the-art labs for future ready communication infrastructure and interoperability have been setup at Bengaluru and Gurugram. Investments are being made in multiple niche technologies such as 5G SA Core, O-RAN radios, to build these solutions indigenously.
- Your company continues to invest in upskilling its talent base of over 600,000 employees. Employees are actively leveraging experiential and personalized learning on a wide range of emerging technologies, clocking over 51 million learning hours in FY 2024. TCS continues to build strong talent supply chains with deep partnerships with leading educational institutions, shaping the curriculum for new skill needs for the future.

On behalf of the Board of Directors of the company, I want to thank you for your continued trust, confidence, and support.

Warm regards,
N Chandrasekaran
Chairman

Telecom industry globally is upgrading communication infrastructure to 5G/6G. These high speed, low latency networks, along with edge compute and AI will become the backbone of businesses in future.

# Letter from the CEO

The rise of GenAI has been catching customers’ attention, and it promises a leap in productivity and accelerates the creation of new products and services. Although still in the early stages of adoption, the use of GenAI is expected to transform every industry.

Dear Stakeholder,

It is my privilege to be writing to you from this desk as we near 20 years to our listing since August 25, 2004. Over the last two decades, your company’s Revenue and Net Profits have grown at a compounded annual growth rate of over 18% each.

It has been almost a full year since my transition as CEO, and I am happy to report that it has been a very stable and seamless experience for all our stakeholders. During this period, we refocused on our industry and technology expertise, emphasized and refreshed the core values that define who we are as a company, and doubled down on customer centricity and employee empathy.

We had a strong finish to the fiscal year FY 2024, with revenue for the year at ₹240,893 crore. This is, a growth of 6.8% over the previous year (3.4% in constant currency). Demand for our services showed remarkable resilience as macroeconomic uncertainties and geopolitical volatilities continued in major markets through the year.

This growth came with an industry leading operating margin of 24.6%. More importantly we exited the year with a quarterly operating margin of 26% in Q4, demonstrating our commitment to the margin band of 26% to 28%. Our Net Margin was at 19.3%.

Among the Business Segments, Manufacturing grew 10.6%, Life Sciences and Healthcare grew 8.7%, Banking, Financial Services and Insurance grew 5.6%, Consumer Business grew 4.9%, Communication, Media and Technology grew 4.6%, while Others grew 14.5% (YoY in reported currency).

Among geographies, growth was led by emerging markets: Latin America grew 21.1%, India grew 20.3%, Middle East &#x26; Africa grew 14.8% while Asia Pacific grew 4.0%. The UK grew 17.7%, Continental Europe grew 6.5%. North America grew 2.3% (YoY in reported currency).

We are seeing strong deal momentum across markets resulting in double-digit growth in our TCV of US$ 42.7 billion, which reflects our deepening partnership with our clients and gives us optimism for the medium to long term growth outlook.

In keeping with our capital allocation policy of returning substantial free cashflow to shareholders, the Board has recommended a final dividend of ₹28 per share, bringing the total dividend for the year to ₹73 per share. The company also successfully completed its fifth buyback program, distributing ₹17,000 crore to shareholders. For the full year, the company’s shareholder payout was ₹47,445 crore, which will be our largest payout to date. Our average shareholder payout has been more than 100% during the last 5 years.

Letter from the CEO

# Business Overview

Established in 1968, our company has been a pioneer in the IT industry, across various technology cycles. At each of these defining moments, we refocused our investments, reinvented ourselves, and helped clients transform their businesses to stay ahead of the technology curve.

During FY 2024, customers continued reprioritization of projects in favor of those which are considered business-critical and where ROI realization is likely faster. We continue to see pressure on customers’ discretionary spending. The recently won deals are converting into revenue as planned, the ongoing engagements started during the pandemic are being re-examined for the incremental value generated. While transformation remains a key ask, customers are expecting the same to be funded through savings from operations. Hence, the key engagement themes we saw during the year were around cost optimization and cloud transformation.

Demand was led by vendor consolidation, cloud migration and transformation, customer and employee experience enhancement, operating model transformation, business process optimization, supply chain initiatives, sustainability, AI enablement i.e. creating a cloud and data foundation for AI, and early-stage AI-infused transformational engagements.

# The Innovation Edge

Exploring innovative uses of GenAI continues to be a key focus area. We are helping our customers to use AI to:

- Assist, leveraging AI to supplement tacit knowledge with contextual knowledge to boost work effectiveness
- Augment, accelerating elite performance through collaborative intelligence, where humans and machines complement and magnify each other’s talents
- Transform, leaping to a knowledge-driven superstructure with fast, consistent, and high-quality decision output to deliver new ways of working and the full realization of enterprise-wide AI.

We have created one of the largest AI / ML and GenAI talent pools in the industry. We have doubled down on partnerships in areas such as AI, cloud, quantum computing and cybersecurity. These early investments have given TCS a head start in being a partner in our customers’ technology adoption journey.

Today, clients are seeing cloud as a strategy for business transformation and growth. The shift to cloud-native products and platforms is being fast-tracked, to achieve increased collaboration, security, scalability and efficiency. Hybrid, multi-cloud platforms are now becoming mainstream. Cloud adoption is a catalyst for innovation, and a strategy for business and growth itself. It provides the unifying digital fabric that forms the foundation for a connected future—one that continues to unfold with each technological advancement, including generative AI (GenAI).

Our continued investments in Research and Innovation, and in building intellectual property, have further strengthened our transformational credentials. Many of our earlier R&#x26;I programs have matured into successful platforms and solutions which performed very well this year and helped differentiate our growth. We leveraged TCS HOBSᵀᴹ to transform Celcom Axiata Berhad’s core business support systems. For PostNord, TCS TwinXᵀᴹ is helping increase sorter capacity, remove bottlenecks, and improve the collection and distribution sort plan. Similarly, TCS Omnistoreᵀᴹ is helping European home improvement company Kingfisher orchestrate a faster, smoother, and seamless checkout experience.

# Building a Skilled Workforce

Our approach to talent is strategic — we consider our employees as key stakeholders in our growth. Our ability to cycle through different technology and business model changes, continuously embrace new knowledge and stay relevant, defines us and gives us a significant edge over our competitors.

We have a strength of 601,546 employees, and our LTM attrition in IT services was 12.5%, down by 760 bps over the previous year. Our workforce continued to be very diverse, with over 152 nationalities represented and with women making up 35.6% of the employee base.

# Letter from the CEO

We launched several initiatives this year to inculcate a strong engineering culture among our employees and build deeper skills in market relevant technologies like Cloud, AI, Cyber Security and more. TCS is collaborating with all the hyperscalers and entering new partnerships with other important players in the AI ecosystem to upskill at scale and build AI computing infrastructure to develop AI solutions for our customers.

In FY 2024, TCSers logged 51 million learning hours, and acquired nearly 5 million competencies. A culture of lifelong learning and innovation, by closely linking learning with careers and rewards, has placed us as the Global Top Employer for the 9th consecutive year, across 32 countries — placing us as one in only 16 organizations worldwide to achieve this status.

# Embracing Aalingana

We have fully adopted Project Aalingana, the Tata group’s sustainability roadmap and the aim is to be net zero by 2045, integrating sustainability into business strategy and concentrating on three interlinked pillars of the project, i.e., promoting the decarbonization of our company and value chains; utilizing a systematic, circular economy approach to reduce resource usage and waste; and protecting and regenerating the environment.

We continue to make good progress in our net zero journey, on the environmental front. TCS had set a target to reduce its absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 70% by 2025 and become net zero by 2030. We are well ahead of our initial Scope 1 and 2 targets and have achieved a reduction of 80% in Scope 1 and 2 emissions in FY 2024 over a baseline of 2016. We are doing this by increasing use of renewable sources of energy and improving energy efficiency.

The company’s strategy for reducing emissions includes addition of more green buildings to the company’s real estate portfolio, reduction of IT system power usage, responsible sourcing, and the use of TCS Clever Energyᵀᴹ, which leverages IoT, machine learning and AI to optimize energy consumption across campuses.

TCS is not only improving its own sustainability but also helping clients develop and implement their sustainability strategies and improve outcomes. We have built a comprehensive suite of over 200 offerings in sustainability services and solutions across different industry verticals. These solutions help enterprises decarbonize their operations and create net-zero pathways, addressing biodiversity loss and growing inequity. We help customers embed circularity in their products and services, by helping design agile, resilient, and sustainable supply chains and promoting reuse, recapture, and recycling.

# Passion for Our Purpose

TCS is meaningfully connecting marginalized groups, including women and youth, to economic opportunities.

# Trading old for new: SIX unveils an advanced post trading platform

With 13,500 trade legs per minute, 13 million transactions per day and few trillion USD worth of securities in custody, SECOM is the electronic post trading system used by SIX for automated processing and settlement of transactions. Built by TCS, SECOM was one of the world’s first real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems and formed the backbone of the Swiss capital market. But can a three-decade old system meet the strenuous demands of modern times? TCS and SIX both knew the answer was ‘no’. SIX decided to embark on a journey of transformation yet again, backed by three decades of relation and trust it shares with TCS.

Back in 1990, when SIX was looking to enhance the scalability of its batch system to meet the market demands of the future, TCS proposed a new platform called SECOM. This platform would be real time, cutting-edge, scalable, and modular with robust architecture. Enabling straight-through processing, it was amongst the most sophisticated systems of its time. Over the years, TCS continued to manage this system for SIX.

Three decades later, SIX partnered with TCS to accomplish another mega feat. TCS executed a PoC to demonstrate the feasibility of modernizing the existing system. TCS showed how this transformation would serve SIX for decades to come – making it more efficient, enabling speed and growth for the firm. Placing trust in TCS’ execution capabilities, SIX decided to go ahead with the transformation. Thus, the next journey from mainframe to an open and more resilient system began.

To take this forward, TCS tapped into its design labs to create a platform that reimagined the user experience and enabled faster response to queries. TCS was able to fast-track this development with an ingenious automation solution which migrated over 500 billion records in record time, saving 10-12 months’ time from the overall process.

The flexible, secure, and cloud-ready platform is economical and makes SIX’ internal operations and process more efficient. The ability to customize individual post trade processes depending on market requirements in different parts of the world has set SIX on a steady path of growth and expansion. With this new and advanced system, SIX became more modern, up to date and market-friendly – boosting customer-centricity and overall competitiveness – and maintaining its pole position in the Swiss financial market.

# CUSTOMER STORIES

TCS has been a critical partner of Experian in this initiative from day 1, working closely with the Support Hub team to structure our requirements and design an intuitive, accessible solution that could be deployed quickly. We’re proud of Support Hub and its impact in supporting vulnerable consumers, and it’s been a pleasure to have TCS join us on this journey.

Paul Lamont

Product Director

Experian Consumer Information Services

# Shaping a future of accessibility and financial inclusion

With TCS as a partner, Experian developed the Support Hub to help vulnerable people get easier access to essential services like banking, utilities, telecom and retail. For the first time, consumers can disclose their support needs to multiple organizations at the same time and have complete control over their data with an intuitive and accessible UX designed exclusively for them.

As the Dublin, Ireland headquartered company helped differently abled people take control of their credit with complete access to their data and offers, it discovered that this demographic is mostly under-served. Organizations across utilities, retail and banking are not aware or not able to cater to their support needs effectively, providing the company an opportunity to get closer to its customer and deliver more accessible products and services.

Leveraging the TCS Paceᵀᴹ and TCS Accessibility Centre of Excellence from design to testing, Support Hub is instrumental in improving Experian’s user engagement. The Experian Support Hub allows people to share their support needs with multiple service providers in a simple, standardized way. For instance, the end customer can now define their needs like requesting statements in Braille or getting longer appointments or more support when visiting a branch.

Through this unique initiative, Experian has been able to expand its partner ecosystem which will help them enter new markets and make a pivotal advancement in fostering financial inclusion. By 2030, Experian aims to help seven million consumers connect with over 200 organizations.

- Deploying the EPC Core and IMS software supplied by C-DOT integrating it with the existing BSNL landscape in a high scalable cloud architecture along with TCS’ Cognitive Network Operations (CNOPS) to efficiently manage and configure the network.
- Install, commission, and optimize the Radios (RAN) meeting the specifications of BSNL and global standards, supplied by Tejas.
- Extend Operations and Maintenance support to the network on an on-going basis.

In response to the Government of India’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ call, TCS collaborated with Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DOT) and Tejas Networks Limited (Tejas) to design and develop an indigenous telecom stack. This complex initiative was undertaken with significant efforts to design the equipment, establish a lab and testing infrastructure of scale besides building the entire manufacturing ecosystem in India. The resultant solution of EPC Core, RAN, IMS, and the cognitive NMS was proven by integrating it in the state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited’s (BSNL) existing network through a well-structured proof of concept. The indigenously designed equipment are programmable and the overall network will be ‘Software Defined’ and highly configurable. With this, India became only the fifth country in the world to have developed this complex technology end to end.

As of April 2024, TCS has delivered 11,000 sites and are well on its way to complete the roll-out by end of this year. BSNL has already added to the scope another 22,000 sites to further densify the coverage and to include ‘saturation’ sites. This is to ensure digital inclusivity to rural and remote areas of India.

Post the satisfactory evaluation of the indigenous telecom stack, BSNL awarded TCS the mandate to supply, install and commission the pan India 4G/5G mobile network across 100,000 sites. The contract involves the following key dimensions:

- Establishing modern cloud native data centers with geographical redundancies for each of the four zones and about 30+ edge data centers closer to the clients.

This is a historic and significant leap towards bridging the digital divide, ushering in the benefits of a powerful voice and data network to all corners of the country. With this, TCS along with its partners is enabling BSNL to enhance its competitiveness, increase revenues, offer a compelling enterprise proposition, and explore new business opportunities.

# A joint venture gives rise to a digitally powered insurance firm

What happens when two companies with a shared vision join forces? We have a greenfield insurance firm that is digital-first, always available and provides gold standard customer experience to its members.

Irish bank, AIB and Great West Life Co entered a joint venture to transform the life, pensions, and investment market in Ireland. They also wanted to address the 35% gender gap in pensions. TCS was selected as a strategic partner for the newly launched AIB life in Ireland, including greenfield operations set up in Letterkenny. TCS helped create a modern, cloud-based technology stack from the ground up with its unique insurance-in-a-box solution.

In Ireland, insurance offerings mainly follow a tiring process where the sales process can take weeks. TCS and AIB life re-imagined the entire journey, with a digital first ambition and customers at the heart of everything.

The entire system was built on a public cloud. The scalable, resilient, and future-ready system was up and running within 15 months and AIB life had exceeded 5,000 new policy sales by the end of 2023.

A dedicated, cloud-enabled contact center and back-office in Ireland supports AIB life’s operations – allowing their distributor to advise customers on 12 different product offerings. Further differentiated products are envisaged to enable AIB life to respond to market changes.

TCS continues to support the firm in its mission of creating truly omnichannel experience, while handling 100+ policy activations on an average day, with self-service capabilities and straight through processing.

“After an extensive review of the market, it was clear that TCS’ contextual industry knowledge, European cloud-based technology and global delivery team based in Letterkenny was a great fit for us. As we build and scale what is a new greenfield life company, it is key that we start on a foundation of cutting-edge technology, and from the outset, establish a digital business with a partner that shares our vision, with the capacity and experience to back our ambition to build our new company at pace, while being committed to delivering the very best for our customers. In addition, TCS’ investment in Ireland through their Global Delivery Centre in Letterkenny, from where we are servicing AIB life customers, enables us to deliver customer service excellence as we support the financial wellbeing of our customers, their families, and their businesses. Being able to do that from within Ireland was particularly important.”

# Travel better with a Next GenAI Solution

A leading North American airline customer wanted to drive operational efficiency throughout the airport operations control domain by enabling key stakeholders with operations information in real time. In addition, their objective was also to improve customer experience through next GenAI technologies.

For all US airlines, 116 million are the delayed minutes every year. With an average of 100 passengers on each flight, this results in 11.6 billion minutes of passenger delays and frustration. Travel better during delays was the core around which the airline customer and TCS embarked on a GenAI journey to help their end customers reach their destination by seamlessly capturing contextual data along with their preferences. TCS’ solution provided a conversational experience to deliver contextualized personalized message while apologizing for the flight delay, leveraging GenAI to ask about preferences including final location, drive time, earliest arrival, or least waiting time along with an end-to-end integration to provide options and rebooking for a seamless passenger experience.

The boarding twin continuously monitors boarding progress and its deviations in real time by merging camera vision data with enterprise events and contextualizing the user experience with proactive and relevant notifications on boarding progress of all flights.

# Warranty Claims Anomaly Detection Solution

The warranty claims received by a global manufacturer of engines and power system products, for its service network included a mix of structured data, narratives/ notes. The notes were used by experts to determine the validity and the warrantable items in a manually adjudicated claim process. In auto adjudicated claims, there were certain anomalous claims that got cleared for payment if met the criteria of a standard claim.

TCS conceptualized and implemented an Intelligent adjudication and anomaly detection solution that automated the review of all claims using Machine Learning for structured data, Natural Language Processing for unstructured data and a scenario-based modelling approach for anomalies, in combination with business rules to provide informed inference to adjudicators or adjust claims wherever apparent before further adjudication.

TCS solution provides a scalable model for all types of claims including traceability needed for decision support, and could automate 91% of claims’ approval, resulting in efficient utilization of adjudicator’s time and improved realization time for the service providers. The solution delivered an increase in productivity hours, an annual savings of over US$5 million in terms of warranty costs and identification of anomalous claims.

# Agent Assist for Travel Insurance Policy Servicing

TCS customer is a leading Global Insurance and Asset Management Provider. The customer’s contact center agents need to respond to user queries related to travel insurance policies’ terms &#x26; conditions across various states it is presently servicing. Agents had to search through many T&#x26;C, resulting in high wait time for the customer.

TCS designed a GenAI led solution to generate quick yet consistent and contextual responses for end users. The state-wise T&#x26;C and insurance plans were extracted and semantically chunked to provide context to GenAI models based on user query. Prompt templates were created to extract contextual information needed for agents to generate responses to the end user query. Guardrails have been implemented using responsible AI principles. Agents can review, validate, and fine tune responses as needed.

The solution can help reduce the average handling time by 40% and thereby result in an overall improvement in customer satisfaction.

# Built Proactive Maintenance Paradigm for Gas Turbine Compressor Casing

TCS customer is a leading electricity generating and gas retailing company in ANZ, whose strategy is to develop new power generation infra and improve existing assets to drive long-term growth while meeting sustainability. Currently, significant fuels used to generate electricity are natural gas and coal and three gas turbines are being used to meet peak load of grid. One of the gas turbine compressor casing had developed crack and functionally failed which resulted in shut down. The customer wanted to avoid these unwanted shutdowns by predicting the survival probability for combustor casings.

TCS’ IP2ᵀᴹ, an intelligent power plant solution that uses AI, IoT, and digital twin technologies was deployed to extract operational life experience profile from timeseries sensors’ information of the gas turbine process including more than seven years of historical data. The solution summarizes the data and predicts and validates crack length based on the same for other gas turbines.

TCS solution has helped in ensuring that the gas turbines operate efficiently and in preventing costly unplanned maintenance and helps in reducing plant O&#x26;M costs while reducing carbon emissions.

# Overview of the Industry

The journey over the past few years has been eventful, starting with supply-chain disruptions in the aftermath of the pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war that triggered a global energy and food crisis, and a considerable surge in inflation, followed by a globally synchronized monetary policy tightening. The global GDP is estimated to have grown at 3.2% in CY 2023, lower than 3.5% in CY 20221, led by fears of a hard recession. Yet, despite many gloomy predictions, the world avoided a recession, the banking system proved largely resilient, and major emerging market economies did not suffer sudden stops. Economic growth has been stronger than expected in the second half of 2023 in the United States, and several major emerging market and developing economies. However, the rising momentum was not felt everywhere, with notably subdued growth in the euro area, reflecting weak consumer sentiment, the lingering effects of high energy prices, and weakness in interest-rate-sensitive sectors.

The outperformance may be attributed to market share gains resulting from TCS’ strategy on customer centricity, its agile organization structure, and a very stable leadership team; its investments in organic talent development, research and innovation, intellectual property, brand building, and in building newer capabilities that have helped expand wallet share with clients; and better execution resulting in greater customer satisfaction.

# TCS’ Business

# An Overview

TCS is an IT services, consulting and business solutions organization partnering many of the world’s largest businesses in their transformational journeys for the last 56 years. It has a global presence, deep domain expertise in multiple industry verticals and a complete portfolio of offerings – grouped under consulting and service integration, application services, digital transformation services, AI and cloud services, engineering services, cognitive business operations, and products and platforms – targeting every C-suite stakeholder.

The company leverages all these capabilities and its profound contextual knowledge of its customers’ businesses to create bespoke, high quality, high impact solutions designed to deliver.

Unmet revenue expectations have ushered in a new wave of pragmatism where maintaining a healthy profit margin has become pivotal for corporations due to the uncertain macro-outlook. In extreme cases, organizations resorted to cost-cutting measures, such as reducing headcount and cutting discretionary spending, including IT services. Organizations taking a more rational approach are simply shifting the emphasis of ongoing IT projects toward cost control, efficiencies and automation while curtailing IT initiatives with longer RoIs. Global technology spending on Enterprise software and IT services was close to the US$2.3 trillion2 mark in CY 2023, with IT services growing at 6.1% YoY to US$1.4 trillion.

The global IT services industry continues to be a highly fragmented one, with even the largest provider having a mid-single digit market share. TCS is among the largest IT services providers globally, with a market share of 2.1%. TCS’ outperformance is significantly higher over the last decade.

# Employee Retention

TCS’ values-driven culture, progressive HR policies, and philosophy of investing in people and empowering them have been integral in creating a culture of belonging. The company’s philosophy of grooming leadership from within and giving the first right of refusal to internal talent for new open positions, inspires higher levels of loyalty to the organization. This has resulted in a very strong, deeply acculturated mid-layer with long tenures in the company. They have played a pivotal role in integrating new talent and have added significant value through their contributions and contextual knowledge.

# Analysis of Revenue Growth and Margin Performance

On a reported basis, TCS’ revenue grew 6.8% in FY 2024, compared to 17.6% in the prior year. The company’s performance showed a remarkable resilience against the backdrop of macro uncertainty and geo-political volatility. Demand for TCS’ services, particularly around cloud adoption, cost optimization, vendor consolidation and operating model transformation, resulted in record deal wins. The newly won deals conversion into revenue continued as expected, but the revenue inflows kept getting neutralized by reduction in the existing revenue base as some of the earlier projects got completed, optimized, or in some cases, downsized. This led to overall muted revenue growth in FY 2024.

EBIT margins were 24.6%* in FY 2024, compared to 24.1% in the previous year. Margin improvement was led by improved productivity, better utilization and reduction in subcontractor expenses.

# Average Currency Exchange Rates

| Currency | Weightage (%) | FY 2024 | FY 2023 | % Change YoY |
| -------- | ------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------ |
| USD      | 53.3          | 82.83   | 80.74   | 2.6          |
| GBP      | 14.4          | 104.07  | 96.98   | 7.3          |
| EUR      | 11.1          | 89.80   | 84.01   | 6.9          |

Movements in currency exchange rates through the year resulted in a positive impact of 3.4% on the reported revenue. The constant currency revenue growth for the year, which is the reported revenue growth stripped of the currency impact, was 3.4%.

# Business Outlook

Global growth estimated at 3.2 percent in 2023 is projected to continue at the same pace in 2024 and 2025. With disinflation and steady growth, the likelihood of a hard landing seems to have receded, and risks to global growth seem broadly balanced. Companies continue to invest heavily in technology to enhance efficiency, security, and customer experience. Rise in spend is expected in cloud computing, ecosystem play and GenAI leading to better resilience and new customer value creation. Cybersecurity will remain a top priority, driving demand for advanced threat detection and prevention solutions.

The uncertainty seen through last year is expected to persist for the next few quarters. Capex investments are projected to remain subdued as enterprises focus on maximizing returns from existing investments, resulting in muted spending on infrastructure, software, and services. Cessation of hostilities and successful control of inflation can be the triggers for recovery which will stimulate global demand. This, in turn, should prompt customers to resume spending on discretionary products and services.

All the above factors provide growth visibility over the medium to long term amid near-term uncertainty. If the delayed decision-making and cash conservation seen in some segments through FY 2024 continues into the next fiscal year, it could lead to a moderation in growth in FY 2025.

# Key demand drivers expected to power the company’s growth in FY 2025 include:

- Despite challenges, spending on IT services has been resilient so far.
- Technology transformation: IT infrastructure modernization, cloud enablement, application and data estate modernization, cloud migration and transformation; data centre and collocated data support; SaaS adoption; digital workplace; digital twins; cyber security; ERP modernization; low-code no-code; 5G/Edge and AI adoption.
- Business Transformation: Customer experience transformation using personalization, omnichannel implementation, immersive experiences using XR/Metaverse; product and business model innovation; supply chain modernization; M&#x26;A integration/divestitures; sustainability, new business model enablement, by harnessing GenAI.
- Operations: Plain vanilla outsourcing, vendor consolidation and multi-services deals; AI/ML-led transformation of IT/business operations for greater resilience and leaner operating models; managed services models and real-time operation visibility.

| Volatile global political and economic environment (R) | * Impact On: Human Capital, Financial Capital
* Geo-politics and macroeconomic volatility can affect demand for the company’s services. The Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas conflict in the last 2 years has continued to lead to supply chain disruptions, energy crises, food and merchandise scarcities and impact on inflation.
* Persistent high inflation in major economies could affect consumer confidence. The current high interest rate environment could result in economic slowdowns, affecting not only spending, but also squeezing liquidity.
* All of these could affect clients’ business outlook and result in reduced demand for TCS’ services. It could also increase TCS’ costs of doing business.
* In addition, there could be risks to service delivery, business continuity, cybersecurity, sanctions compliance and human rights risks in geo-politically sensitive zones, all of which could increase costs or affect the company’s revenue growth. | - Broad-based business mix, well diversified across geographies and industry verticals.

# Internal Financial Control Systems and their Adequacy

TCS has aligned its systems of internal financial control in line with globally accepted risk-based framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. This framework of internal financial controls meets the requirement of the Companies Act 2013. The Internal Control – Integrated Framework (the 2013 framework) is intended to increase transparency and accountability in an organization’s process of designing and implementing a system of internal control. The framework requires a company to identify and analyze risks and manage appropriate responses. The company has successfully laid down the framework and ensured its effectiveness.

B S R &#x26; Co. LLP, the statutory auditors of TCS, have audited the financial statements included in this annual report and have issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in section 143 of Companies Act 2013).

TCS has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers Services LLP to oversee and carry out an internal audit of its activities. Design and operating effectiveness of process controls on financial transactions is also audited by an independent in-house internal audit team. The audit is based on an internal audit plan, which is reviewed each year in consultation with the statutory auditors and approved by the audit committee. In line with international practice, the conduct of internal audit is oriented towards the review of internal controls and risks in the company’s operations such as software delivery, accounting and finance, procurement, employee engagement, travel, insurance, IT processes, including the subsidiaries and foreign branches.

TCS’ internal controls are commensurate with its size and the nature of its operations. These have been designed to provide reasonable assurance with regard to recording and providing reliable financial and operational information, complying with applicable statutes, safeguarding assets from unauthorized use, executing transactions with proper authorization and ensuring compliance with corporate policies. TCS has a well-defined delegation of power with authority limits commensurate with the responsibilities for approving engagements with all stakeholders that commits organizational resources and results in creation of assets and liabilities, income and expenditure.

TCS uses a state-of-the-art enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that connects all parts of the organization, to record data for accounting, consolidation and management information purposes. It has continued its efforts to align all its processes and controls with global best practices.

TCS management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Regulation 17 of SEBI LODR Regulations 2015) as of March 31, 2024. TCS’ audit committee has concluded that, as of March 31, 2024, the company’s internal financial controls were adequate and operating effectively.

# I. Company’s Philosophy on Corporate Governance

Effective corporate governance practices constitute the strong foundation on which successful commercial enterprises are built to last. The Company’s philosophy on corporate governance oversees business strategies and ensures fiscal accountability, ethical corporate behaviour and fairness to all stakeholders comprising employees, investors, customers, regulators, suppliers and the society at large. Strong leadership and effective corporate governance practices have been the Company’s hallmark inherited from the Tata culture and ethos.

The Company follows the Tata Group philosophy of building sustainable businesses that are rooted in the community and demonstrate care for the environment. Being a part of the Tata Group, which epitomizes sustainability, the Company has inherited a strong legacy of fair and transparent ethical governance, as embodied in the Tata Code of Conduct (“TCoC”).

The Company has adopted the TCoC for its employees including the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director and the Executive Directors. In addition, the Company has adopted a Code of Conduct for its non-executive directors which includes Code of Conduct for Independent Directors that suitably incorporates the duties of independent directors as laid down in the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”).

The Company is in compliance with the requirements stipulated under Regulations 17 to 27 read with Schedule V and clauses (b) to (i) and (t) of sub-regulation (2) of Regulation 46 of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“SEBI Listing Regulations”), as applicable, with regard to corporate governance.

The details of TCS’ board structure and the various committees that constitute the governance structure¹ of the organization are covered in detail in this report. The various material aspects of corporate governance and TCS’ approach to them are discussed in the table below:

# TCS’ Approach

- Gender: Two (22.2 percent) of the nine Directors are women.
- Nationality: Four nationalities represented – Indian, American, Danish and British.
- Industry: Technology, Banking, Energy, Transportation and Academia.

TCS’ policy on Appointment of Directors and Board Diversity can be found at https://on.tcs.com/appointment-BoD.

Board independence is ensured by having an independent majority, with 5 independent directors out of 9 i.e., 55.6 percent. None of the Independent Directors is related to each other, or to the non-independent directors. Average tenure of independent directors is 6 years.

Board effectiveness is further improved by ensuring that none of the directors holds directorships in more than seven listed entities, and none of the executive directors serves as an independent director on the Boards of more than three listed entities.

TCS’ governance philosophy around minority Shareholders’ interests is guided by the TCoC which emphasizes fairness and transparency to all stakeholders. Further a qualified, diverse and independent Board ensures that minority shareholders’ interests are protected.

TCS strives to reduce information asymmetry through transparency, extensive disclosures and detailed commentary of the demand environment and the state of the business, and material developments. The Company provides a variety of channels including a structured global investor outreach program, through which minority shareholders can interact with the management or the Board.

Shareholders can communicate concerns and grievances to the Company Secretary’s office through a well-publicized channel, where complaints are tracked till closure. The Stakeholders’ Relationship Committee oversees the redressal of these complaints.

# Avoidance of conflict of interest

Chairmanship4 of the Board is a non-executive position, and separate from that of the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director (“CEO &#x26; MD”).

TCoC5 for non-executive directors, and for independent directors, carries explicit clauses covering avoidance of conflict of interest. Likewise, it explicitly prohibits any employee, including the executive directors, from accepting any position of responsibility, with or without remuneration, with any other organization without TCS’ prior written approval. For the executive directors, such approval must be obtained from the Board.

# Values, Ethics and compliance

Over the last five decades, TCS has consistently demonstrated very principled conduct and has earned its reputation for trust and integrity while building a highly successful global business. The Company’s core values are: Integrity, Responsibility, Excellence, Pioneering and Unity.

The TCoC serves as a moral guide and a governing framework for responsible corporate citizenship. It sets out guidelines on various topics including respect for human rights, prohibition of bribery and corruption, recognition of employees’ freedom of association, and avoidance of conflicts of interest.

Every employee of the Company is required to sign the TCoC at the time of joining. Web-based annual refresher courses are mandated to ensure continued awareness of the Code. Further, frequent communications from the leadership, reiterate the importance of the Company values and the TCoC.

Customers are made aware of the TCoC principles in contract discussions, and through inclusion of specific clauses in proposals and contracts.

Employees also undergo Web-based mandatory training every year on Anti-bribery and ethical behaviour. They can raise ethics concerns on Ultimatix – the intranet portal of the Company, which are investigated and tracked to closure by the HR department. Employees and other stakeholders can also report any non-compliance to the TCoC or to the laws of the land by senior executives directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee under the Whistle blower Policy without fear of retaliation. Information about these channels is communicated to employees as part of the mandatory training modules.

# Material Topic

# TCS’ Approach

Compliance to laws of the countries in which we operate, as well as global legislation such as Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Bribery Act, 2010, etc. are monitored through formal compliance procedures led by the Corporate compliance office. Changes to legislation are closely monitored, risks are evaluated and effectively managed across the business operations. Governance, Risk and Compliance are overseen by the Compliance Officer, Chief Risk Officer and the Chief Human Resources Officer who report to the Chief Operating Officer and Executive Director (“COO &#x26; ED”), and CEO &#x26; MD respectively. At the apex level, the Audit Committee headed by an Independent Director oversees compliance to the TCoC, Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy, Gift and Hospitality Policy and also to the external regulations.

# Tax Strategy7

TCS is committed to comply with the applicable laws and regulations, and believes in reporting to the respective tax authorities, relevant information that is complete and accurate, in a timely manner. TCS does not engage in aggressive and contrived tax planning or tax structuring for the purpose of gaining tax advantages. TCS’s tax policy is to optimize the tax cost, avail tax incentives where available, while achieving 100 per cent compliance with the spirit as well as the letter of the tax laws and regulations in all countries in which it operates. Compliance is achieved through a robust compliance reporting and monitoring process, with a strong governance on minimizing the tax risk. TCS has zero tolerance towards tax evasion, or the facilitation of tax evasion, by itself or by its employees or vendors. TCS maintains open and collaborative relationships with governments and tax authorities worldwide. Where appropriate, TCS seeks advance clearance from tax authorities on the proposed tax treatment of transactions, helping pre-empt future disputes.

# Board Oversight of Sustainability Matters8

TCS’ approach to sustainable growth is built on the belief that it can expand its business by creating longer term value for all its stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers and local communities, while also valuing the environment. The various sustainability topics material to TCS are overseen by the relevant Board committees, as outlined below:

# Succession planning

TCS’ philosophy of empowering employees, its industry-leading talent retention, and a decentralized organization structure that devolves executive decision-making across all business units have resulted in a large and deep bench of leadership talent that enables robust succession planning and continuity and consistency in strategy. Succession planning for the top two leadership positions in each business unit is reviewed by senior management. Additionally, heads of business units carry out succession planning for key functions within their units. Succession planning at senior management levels is reviewed by the Board. Business or unit heads are invited to present on specific topics at Board meetings from time to time, offering an opportunity to the directors to assess their values, competencies, and capabilities.

# Corporate Social Responsibility

# Empowering Access to Opportunity

# Overview

We live in interesting times with technologies like Artificial Intelligence dominating the global conversation, the human impact of natural disasters calling attention to the need for climate adaptation, and a worldwide call to action for inclusive growth as economies transition post the pandemic.

TCS recognizes the power of technology, innovation, and human ingenuity in building a more equitable world. TCS believes that everyone is born with equal potential, but not equal opportunity and it is the vision of TCS to empower people and communities to build self-reliance while promoting the core values of fairness, equity, and respect for human rights.

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24


# Corporate Social Responsibility

This past year TCS has made significant progress in its mission, empowering over 7 million people through its CSR programs including big bets aimed at people with highest need, in communities where resources are low, while using its core strengths to make a meaningful impact. This resulted in upward socio-economic mobility for 797,749 people, building equitable and inclusive pathways for 405,775 women, 455,692 youth and 547,311 from marginalized groups.

This was achieved by scaling TCS’ high impact programs across India and 43 countries around the world, against four strategic themes (and eight focus areas): provide a 21st century education for all (Education and Research, Literacy to Livelihood), help citizens equitably access good jobs of tomorrow (Employment through Skilling, Digital Entrepreneurship), enable delivery of world class front-line services in poorest districts (Healthcare, Digital Inclusion), and accelerate the just transition to a green economy (Water, Climate and Sustainability). No one organization can do this alone, and TCS through its purpose ecosystem engaged the key stakeholders to support the needs of the local communities.

TCS served 20,342 marginalized people through its Literacy as a Service program, empowering them through functional, financial, and digital literacy. Gaining self-confidence, dignity, and access to key citizen entitlements, they traversed a path from a vicious cycle of poverty, bonded labor, and harsh work conditions to charting their own course of savings and livelihood.

The onus of building Responsible AI rests not with today’s companies, workforce, and policy makers, but more so lies in the hands of the next generation of innovators. Empowering 6,209 teachers to inculcate computational thinking, Ignite my Future program of TCS prepared 312,966 students across five continents with foundational skills for the age of AI, while the goIT digital innovation program inspired 118,016 students across 42 countries apply 21st Century Skills and latest technologies like AI, IoT, and App Design to solve real-world problems in their community. The most gratifying aspect is 53% of these students are girls and 76% from underrepresented minorities.

Gaining access to quality jobs in today’s digital economy can often be a challenge, even for those educated from leading institutions. TCS imparted marketable skills, credentials, and valuable certifications to 23,297 rural youth from 24 states and union territories across India, coaching and mentoring them for industry readiness through its Youth Employment Program. Nearly half of these are women, improving their income opportunities and participation in economic growth.

Across 1,735 villages in rural India, digital entrepreneurs from the TCS program ‘BridgeIT’, are earning their livelihood while providing much needed last-mile services to 312,175 beneficiaries such as access to citizen entitlements, banking, financial services, insurance, telehealth, telelaw, logistics, ecommerce and more. Expanding the program to 44 districts, a new cohort of 1,400 women entrepreneurs from socially marginalized background are gearing up to be catalysts to strengthen the rural economy.

In a transformational year for community service, HOPE (Hours of Purpose by Employees), a TCS program saw volunteers contribute over 6.7 million hours to support the poor with basic necessities, to create better health outcomes for those who need help, to preserve and protect the environment, to empower better education, employment, entrepreneurship, and livelihoods for the marginalized. TCSers also built capacity and capability for over 50 social sector organizations through skills-based volunteering, providing in-kind digital, advisory and technology consulting services.

TCS jointly served needy communities around the world through 138 purpose partnerships, working alongside other Tata Group companies, its customers, and like-minded organizations through its Business with Purpose program. TCS harnessed the wisdom of over 1,800 cross-sector leaders through 11 Digital Empowers thought leadership forums, using their collective wisdom to help advance advocacy and policy efforts globally.

# Literacy as a Service (LaaS)

Inadequate adult literacy is a problem preventing India from achieving its full economic potential. Majority of the non-literate population comprises women, and from marginalized communities. TCS’ Literacy as a Service (LaaS) program addresses non-literacy among adults and creates awareness of key citizen entitlements. It serves the dual purpose of improving the literacy rate in the country and promoting social inclusion and financial stability for marginalized communities. LaaS’ innovative teaching method leverages technology, the theory of cognition, and the laws of perception.

| Beneficiaries:             | 19,761 |
| -------------------------- | ------ |
| Preraks:                   | 581    |
| Vulnerable & marginalized: | 99%    |

# Literacy as a Service (LaaS) Case Study

LaaS’ modules include functional literacy (50-55 hours), financial literacy (5-7 hours), and awareness of key citizen entitlements (3-4 hours). These are currently available in nine Indian, and three foreign languages.

Democratizing the literacy solution, TCS’ Each one Empowers one portal provides TCS, Tata Group employees, and their families, the opportunity to empower non-literates such as security guards, domestic workers, and gardeners in their local community.

Since its inception, LaaS has successfully paved the way to self-reliance for over 2.43 million learners and more than 201,600 facilitators through literacy. In FY 2024, LaaS empowered 20,342 learners (~99% women) with functional literacy, financial literacy, and awareness of key citizen entitlements.

| Trained:                   | 19,900 |
| -------------------------- | ------ |
| Under Training:            | 3,397  |
| Placed:                    | 2,845  |
| Vulnerable & marginalized: | 49%    |

The program’s transformational impact offers beneficiaries a path to financial independence, raises their self-esteem, and provides them the opportunity to be role models for their children. In addition, the program has also given neo-literates better access to government benefit schemes, and financial systems.

The high unemployment rate among the youth, particularly from marginalized communities is a significant issue in modern India. Their employment prospects and their ability to participate in the digital economy are impacted by challenges such as limited opportunities, deficient communication skills, and a lack of technical expertise. TCS’ Youth Employment Program (YEP) empowers the youth with its “Teach, Coach, Mentor and Place” model. Industry leaders and subject matter experts collaborate to deliver comprehensive training on business communication, aptitude, computer programming, and domain-specific skills.

The program facilitates a seamless transition between the academic and professional worlds and elevates the beneficiaries’ social and economic standing. By providing career guidance, mentoring, and offering access to market-relevant certifications and real-time projects, YEP equips the youth to navigate opportunities in the Indian job market.

# Lighting up the Musahar Community with literacy

Tara Devi, from Bhaipurkhurd village, in Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh, used to work at a brick kiln, for 14-16 hours every day, along with her husband and children. The owner of the brick kiln exploited them and paid them inadequately. Lacking basic education, Tara and her family were unable to accurately calculate their wages and were dependent on middlemen. TCS’ Literacy as a Service (LaaS), in partnership with Manav Sansadhan Evam Mahila Vikas Sansthan (MSEMVS), started a literacy program in Bhaipurkhurd. Tara Devi was rescued by MSEMVS, and she joined the TCS’ literacy center at Bhaipurkhurd.

Attending TCS’ LaaS sessions every day, Tara Devi learned how to read basic Hindi and do simple arithmetic. MSEMVS assisted Tara in setting up a small general shop. She is now able to operate her microenterprise independently and personally maintain her book of accounts. Realizing the transformative power of education, Tara Devi inspires her children to take their education seriously.

Her father who was a security guard at Tata Consultancy Services, informed her about a program designed to assist recent graduates find employment. Puja was advised to send her resume to see if she qualified for the training. Soon after, she received an invitation to the "Youth Employment Programme" (YEP) orientation. There she met other enthusiastic young individuals who shared similar career dreams.

YEP helped enhance her analytical, numerical, and communication skills. Throughout the training, she also acquired fundamental skills such as time management, work-life balance, and corporate etiquette. She learned the significance of creating an outstanding resume and received guidance on conduct during interviews.

Upon completing the training, she appeared for the TCS recruitment drive and was selected for a position at TCS's Vikhroli office. Her feeling of joy was immeasurable. Puja dedicates her success to YEP and all the TCSers who helped her.

A major achievement of BridgeIT in FY 2024 was the agreement between TCS and Humana People to People India (HPPI), to empower 1,400 rural youth from socially and economically marginalized communities across 14 districts of Bihar, Jharkhand, and Rajasthan, by building their capacities to become digital entrepreneurs.

A TCS Entrepreneur Network (TEN) was created to encourage collaborative knowledge sharing and revenue generation ideas among existing and future entrepreneurs. The TCS team connects regularly with the entrepreneurs for this purpose. Training modules were created and conducted on topics such as Cyber Security, Cyber Crime, DTP, and Canva.

An in-house guidebook to learn and adopt new ways to generate income has also been developed. Additionally, Digital Entrepreneur Learning Intervention (DELI), the TCS in-house training curriculum, and content for future training programs has also been created.

# Shashi Kujur - Digital Mukhiya

Shashi Kujur is today a beacon of empowerment in Kura. While Shashi like many women from her community married young, she was different. Driven by the ambition to achieve something significant in life, she delayed starting a family with her husband. In 2020, on hearing news of TCS's BridgeIT, Shashi decided to enroll in the program. Equipped with training, a laptop, and determination, she transformed a room in her home into a digital service hub.

Initially offering a few services, Shashi gradually expanded to offer 24 services to her community, including PAN cards and financial services. With time, Shashi gained recognition in her village. Her success propelled her to run for Mukhiya in Jharkhand, earning the moniker of "Digital Mukhiya."

Students: 118,016   Educators: 3,632   Vulnerable &#x26; marginalized: 76%

Around the world, there are more jobs in STEM and the computer sciences than there are qualified candidates to fill them. There is also a lack of understanding of what goes into becoming a STEM or computer science professional. The National Science Foundation predicts that 80% of the jobs that will be created in the next decade will require skills in mathematics and science. TCS’ flagship digital innovation and career readiness program, go Innovate Together (goIT), prepares students with the skills and capabilities required to pursue careers of the future.

Through engaging design workshops and custom mentorship experiences, goIT helps students by challenging stereotypes and inspiring these future leaders to pursue the careers of tomorrow. goIT helps students develop core skills in partnerships with school districts, using a four-pronged model which includes, in-person or virtual volunteer-driven engagements, round the year goIT online connects, monthly challenges centered around the UN SDGs and mentorship by industry professionals from TCS. The impact metrics from participating students reinforce the success of the program, with 89% aspiring to pursue STEM careers post-program, 96% believing they can create positive community impact, and 99% learning new skills from TCS mentor volunteers. goIT’s transformative journey helps shape the future of STEM education. Since its launch in 2009, goIT has benefitted 263,282 students with a growing presence across 42 countries.

# Ignite My Future (IMF)

Students: 312,966   Educators: 6,209   Vulnerable &#x26; marginalized: 64%

The world is evolving at a tremendous pace, and now more than ever, young people require 21st-century skills, such as computational thinking, to keep abreast with the changing times, create avenues for new jobs, and explore possibilities for economic equity. Emerging technologies like GenAI highlight how core school subjects alone will no longer be enough.

Computational thinking is a foundational skill that prepares students to think, solve, and create. TCS’ Ignite My Future (IMF) is a pioneering endeavor to empower educators.

# Case Study

# Record-breaking female participation in Honolulu

Statistics reveal that women represent fewer than 28% of the world’s technology workforce, a fact echoed by even lower numbers in the U.S. That is why goIT’s achievement in one middle school in Honolulu, Hawaii, sends such a strong message. goIT’s first-ever classroom program in Hawaii, with a group that comprised 75% girls, featured the highest ratio of attending girls ever achieved in a goIT co-ed offering. TCS partnered with St. Andrews schools to bring goIT to 4th and 6th grade students, who spent three months working their way through a transdisciplinary approach that integrates computational thinking into core subjects like mathematics, science, art, and social studies.

Offered for free, IMF enables educators to teach students equitably. The program highlights the importance of computational thinking as a critical skill in a changing world with complex problems that require thoughtful solutions. Through TCS volunteering and customer engagements with program partners, IMF brings career pathways to life by creating awareness for students on potential careers. IMF consistently engages with educators and students through the Learning Leaders network, family STEM nights, and special student projects.

This year, IMF introduced a new offering: Behind the Scenes, Employee Volunteering Program a virtual field trip model that empowers teachers with high-quality video and activity content to inspire students as they become today’s problem solvers in tomorrow’s world. The first-ever Behind the Scenes content is designed in partnership with a fellow Tata Group company, Jaguar Land Rover, through Jaguar TCS Racing partnership via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship.

Since its inception in 2017, IMF has positively impacted over 2.32 million teachers and students around the world. In FY 2024, IMF benefited 312,966 students and 6,209 educators across ANZ, APAC, India, LATAM, North America, and UK &#x26; Ireland.

Volunteering has a new home at TCS. Hours of Purpose by Ignite My Future (IMF) Case Study - Igniting Futures at full speed: cross-sector efforts that inspire generations

Ignite My Future At Track is a novel program within the IMF universe of resources that offers teachers and students the opportunity to peep behind the scenes and discover how STEM careers can be fully compatible with someone’s passion for something, like motor sports. Thanks to cross-sector efforts, TCS gave IMF alumni and IMF Learning Leaders the opportunity to witness firsthand how the Jaguar TCS Racing Team uses problem-solving strategies in computational thinking to ensure a successful race. Students' interest in STEM careers grew by 40%. 75% felt more likely to use computational thinking strategies in real-life situations, and 100% of teachers in the immediate community showed newly acquired interest in the program. It is said that “it takes a village to raise a child” and Ignite My Future’s efforts make sure no child is left behind.

Employees (HOPE) is a transformational movement that allows TCS’ growing, highly skilled, and diverse personnel to champion purpose projects and give back to society. The program transformed volunteering from an occasional activity into a strategic force for positive change. Through HOPE, employees can choose activities in different localities, along with corporate-driven programs, primarily focused on the 17 UN SDGs. All HOPE projects are guided, monitored, and driven by ‘Purpose Councils’ comprising leaders from regions and business units who believe in the Tata Ethos of giving back to society. TCS believes that HOPE’s strong, purpose-driven ecosystem is vital to create change that will stand the test of time and generate positive impact.

# TCS: #1 company for volunteers

Through HOPE, TCS became the leading company for volunteers. For the first time, multiple volunteering events (over 250) were organized under one platform, allowing 182,000 volunteers to choose what they volunteer for, how they volunteer (DIY/virtual/in-person), and who they volunteer with (friends and family).

And miles to go… In FY 2024, HOPE resulted in a collective impact of 6.72 million volunteer hours, primarily addressing six SDGs. The platform reached 11.17 PCVH (Per Capita Volunteering Hours) and positively impacted 5.41 million lives. As more TCSers and their friends and family join hands with HOPE, striving to be purposeful stewards of their communities, this movement is set to continuously grow and touch more lives.

Since I was introduced to Ignite My Future by my teacher in the classroom, I felt there was a difference in my day to day living. Computational Thinking was something I could use in my daily problems too. Then, when I realized I was going to be given the chance to be part of Ignite My Future At Track, I discovered how interesting the world of STEM is and how it’s not just what you see in a book. Not only am I a big fan of race cars now, but I am also sure I am going to pursue a career in STEM now.

Hours of Purpose by Employees (HOPE) is a wonderful initiative to celebrate the efforts of people who work selflessly to bring about positive change in society. Personally, participating and contributing hours to HOPE initiatives allowed me to be a part of the community and provided me with a sense of belonging. Going to NGOs and working with the team members helped unite my teams of young volunteers who want to build a better society and put a smile on the faces of beneficiaries.

No. This is not applicable to TCS. TCS does not have any physical products as a part of its offerings to customers. TCS is primarily an IT services organization and products, if any, are typically software products. Hence the applicability of life-cycle approach to TCS’ core operations is rather limited. Application of a life cycle approach is hence restricted to the services and products procured by TCS for its own operations. Most of the product categories procured are off-the-shelf items. Hence, the life cycle philosophy as extended to these include green procurement considerations as a part of the technical specifications for purchase and end-of-life management to maximize recycling.
2. If there are any significant social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising from production or disposal of your products / services, as identified in the Life Cycle Perspective / Assessments (LCA) or through any other means, briefly describe the same along-with action taken to mitigate the same44.

Stakeholder interactions result in the identification of a broad funnel of issues important to each of the constituencies. The Company uses discussions with internal and external stakeholders, as well as its own judgment, to prioritize and arrive at a list of material topics with significant economic, environmental, or social impacts on TCS’ business, reputation, and operations. The TCS management shares feedback with the Board on these issues.

# 2.

• At TCS, remuneration is same for men and women working full-time, in the same grade, in the same role, and at the same location, and with the same level of experience. Where relevant, the company publishes the raw mean and median pay differences between genders (not normalized for part-timers or grade and role differences) on its own website as well as on public sites.

There were no significant risks / concerns arising from the assessments.

# PRINCIPLE 6: Businesses should respect and make efforts to protect and restore the environment

# Essential Indicators

1. # Details of total energy consumption (in Joules or multiples) and energy intensity, in the following format:

Electricity from the grid is the most significant form of energy for TCS. Over the years, TCS has increased the share of Renewable Electricity (RE) through “green-tariff” schemes offered by the state electricity providers, onsite rooftop solar generation and procurement from third party producers in India. In certain countries, Energy Attribute Certificates (EAC) have been procured to meet out carbon neutrality objectives in those geographies. The RE consumption as a percentage of total energy consumption has increased from 55.2% in FY 2022-23 to 74% in FY 2023-24. Electricity consumption across TCS operations increased by 14.6% y-o-y on account of increased scale of operations in FY 2023-24 compared to previous year, due to more associates returning to office. An inclusion of 14 locations globally in the reporting boundary during the current year attributed to a 2.8% increase leading to an overall increase in electricity consumption.

Other sources of energy include natural gas (mainly used for space heating/cooling, district heating and cooling, mostly in overseas geographies), fuel used in company owned vehicles, cooking gas used in cafeteria and diesel used in diesel generators (mainly used as a back-up source during power shortages).

# 8. Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details⁷⁶.

Yes. TCS has taken up the target to reduce its absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon footprint by 70% by 2025 and become net zero by 2030. To achieve these targets, the green-house gas management approach has four key levers – green infrastructure, green IT, IT-enabled operational efficiencies, and renewable energy.

# Commitment to Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)

In June 2022, TCS has responded to SBTi’s urgent call for corporate climate action by committing to align with 1.5°C and net-zero through the Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign. This is published on SBTi website and can be viewed at Companies taking action- https://sciencebasedtargets.org/companies-taking-action. TCS is working on the next steps to developing company targets for validation by SBTi.

# Green Infrastructure and IT enabled operational efficiency:

All new campuses owned by TCS are designed according to green building standards for energy and resource efficiency. They have roof-top solar photovoltaic installations to reduce the carbon footprint. The total Built Up Area occupied by TCS has increased YoY from 36.6 Mn to 38.23 million sq.ft. in FY 2023-24. With the increasing footprint, TCS is committed to expand consciously its green footprint, to align with its sustainability goals. In FY 2023-24, TCS got Platinum IGBC certification for 2 additional existing buildings namely Sholinganallur, Chennai and Deccan Park, Hyderabad. The % green certified area over built up area was 64.6% in FY 2022-23 and has increased to 67.3% this year. This accounts for 39 TCS offices and campuses with over 25.74 million sq.ft of area under certified green building by Indian Green Building Council.

75 GRI 305-1; GRI 305-2, GRI 305-4. Scope 1 emissions have been calculated using the emissions factors published by the DEFRA conversion factors 2023. For Scope 2 emissions – for India, the source is the emission factor is the CO2 Baseline Database for the Indian Power Sector, User Guide, Version 19.0, December 2023, published by the Central Electricity Authority of India. This emission factor [(0.716 tCO2/ MWh) by CEA includes the captive power injection into the grid and is adjusted for RE transactions through open access (in power exchanges)]. As TCS, India procures electricity from the India grid, which is a mix of conventional and renewable energy, the emission factor of 0.716 tCO2/ MWh is considered more appropriate. For Australia, Canada, North America, and UK emission factors specific to the region published by local authorities are used. For other countries IEA v6 emission factors (01/2024) and GHG protocol v19 (04/2023) – eGRID 2021 have been used as appropriate to the source of electricity procured.

During the year, several initiatives were aligned to achieve the carbon targets which included those in building and IT infrastructure. Initiatives in building infrastructure included energy efficiencies in HVAC systems, Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS), and chillers.

- HVAC system upgradation by installation of latest technology VRF systems which works on inverter technology.
- Use of High Efficiency VFD based chillers.
- Replacement of R-22 based &#x26; fixed compressor-based HVAC equipment with inverter technology-based equipment.
- Modular UPS which can modulate its capacity based on load and helps provide 90-95% efficiency, even at lower loads.
- Life cycle based replacement of HVAC equipment like chillers, pumps and cooling towers has helped reduce our energy consumption.
- Energy optimization in our operations through IoT based solutions, remote monitoring, analytics and automated feedback mechanism.
- As our commitment to energy conservation and management, 2 additional campuses in India were certified to ISO 50001:2018 standards for Energy Management Systems (EnMS) in FY 2023-24, making it to a total of 22 campuses certified to ISO 50001:2018 across TCS India.

# Green IT:

Initiatives in green Information Technology (IT) focused on data center and IT device consolidation and optimization to reduce the carbon footprint. The areas covered under green IT initiatives include IT energy optimization in data centers and equipment rooms. TCS’ data centers at Yantra Park (Thane) and Siruseri (Chennai) have a weighted average PUE of 1.7. Apart from the two main data centers, TCS also has 54 equipment rooms for business as usual (BAU) activities, wherein the weighted average PUE has reduced from 1.88 in FY 2022-23 to 1.76 in FY 2023-24.

The data centre at Yantra Park uses 100% Renewable Energy (RE) while the one at Siruseri uses 73% RE. The power consumed by the data centers at Yantra Park and Siruseri were 5.52 MWh and 1.65 MWh respectively during the reporting year FY 2023-24. In addition to the above, green attributes are considered in every IT asset procurement.

TCS’ IoT-based Real-time Energy Management System (TCS Clever Energy™) initiative involves real time monitoring to optimize the operational energy efficiency across all offices. The smart, scalable, analytics driven IoT solution uses TCS Connected Universe Platform (TCUP) IoT platform, which forms the backbone, enabling visualization of data acquired from various locations and facilities’ energy meters and sensors. Other energy optimization initiatives include:

- IT Equipment optimization (rack consolidation, server consolidation and procurement of energy efficient devices).
- UPS optimization (right sizing of UPS, replacement of old technology UPS with modular UPS).
- Cooling optimization (switching off excess capacity cooling units, maintaining return set temperature at 24 +/- 1 deg C, replacing old with new technology cooling units).
- Leakage reduction (proper alignment of racks and perforated tiles, partitioning to reduce cooling area, cold aisle containment, blanking panel, active tiles and soft partitioning).

# Renewable Energy:

The roof top solar photo voltaic installations this year remained at 10.2 MWp contributing to 3 percent of total electricity use in FY 2023-24. A rooftop solar PV of 260 KWp has been planned for implementation in early FY 2024-25. The Company increased its renewable energy procurement through a) switch over to green tariffs for its operations in Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Chennai, Kochi and Trivandrum branches, b) Green energy units procurement through Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) at two locations in Chennai viz. Ambattur and Chennai One, Magnum, which cumulatively added about 6.5 million green units to the renewable energy portfolio). The renewable energy procurement has resulted in an increase in renewable energy use to 74 percent of total energy use.

# Carbon Neutrality:

The company became carbon neutral across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in North America, UK and Ireland, Europe, Asia Pacific (including Japan), Latin America, and Middle East &#x26; Africa in FY 2023-24.

# 9. Provide details related to waste management by the entity, in the following format:

TCS being an IT services and consulting organization, TCS does not manufacture physical products and therefore do not use any hazardous or toxic chemicals in core processes. The Company have office or facility operations, and the waste is generated from the auxiliary processes used to run these facilities. Based on the nature of its services, TCS’ facilities mostly generate electronic, electrical, and municipal solid waste. Potentially hazardous and regulated wastes such as lead-acid batteries and waste lube oil are generated in relatively smaller proportions which are disposed through government-approved recyclers as per regulations. E-waste is disposed to government approved e-waste recyclers.

TCS is committed to sustain the best practices that have already been institutionalized like segregation of all recyclable wastes, 100% compliance to management practices for regulated wastes like hazardous and e-waste and 100% recycling of office and packaging paper and plastic. All TCS campuses, owned offices and leased offices that have available space are provided with on-site food waste management facilities such as biodigesters and organic waste converters (OWCs) and garden waste is treated by vermicomposting at TCS campuses where feasible. The company targets to maximize the recycling and reuse of all waste categories to divert waste from landfill.

In FY 2023-24, TCS has obtained zero waste to landfill (ZWL) certification was obtained for TCS Deccan Park facility at Hyderabad after having achieved a diversion rate of over 99% waste from landfill. This was done as a pilot project for feasibility.

TCS has operational control procedures (OCPs) for waste management and handling of different categories of wastes which is available on the TCS intranet that has set procedures for waste segregation, handling, storage, and disposal of different waste categories.

#Data excludes accounting for &#x3C;2% headcount, where TCS does not have operational control.

** 100% of the regulated waste (e-waste, battery waste) is disposed through recycling. The generated quantities, if remaining at the end of the financial year for disposal, are stored at the facilities and recycled through approved/ authorized vendors. In FY 2023-24 waste data reported on a consolidated level where TCS have operational control. Therefore, the construction &#x26; demolition (C&#x26;D) waste from new construction or under construction sites are revised. The data for FY 2022-23 is accordingly restated. All non hazardous waste categories have been restated for FY 2022-23 to make it consistent with the categories reported in FY 2023-24.

# 83 GRI 305-3, GRI 305-4; There are some inclusions and modifications in estimating scope 3 carbon emissions during FY 2024 when compared to FY 2023.

Scope 3 emissions:

Category 1 &#x26; 2: Emission factors (spend based) for purchased and capital goods are taken from the latest available US EPA (Supply Chain GHG Emission Factors for US Commodities and Industries v1.1.1) information for computer equipment, electrical equipment, office equipment, vehicles, and furniture items. The US EPA emission factors for categories 1 &#x26; 2 were adopted in FY23 and used in FY24 as well. There is a significant increase in Category 1 due to a new contract. Increase in category 2 is due to Return to Office (RTO).

Category 3: The well to tank (WTT) emissions from the fuel used in stationary and mobile combustion such as diesel in DG sets and owned vehicles, LPG or PNG in cafeteria, natural gas for space heating/ cooling, fuel used in hired vehicles (cabs/ buses) are included in this category since FY 2023 and the same has been continued in FY2024 as well. There is an increase in emissions due to use of IEA emission factors for WTT and T&#x26;D in FY24. In FY23 the Company had used the DEFRA emission factors.

Category 4: Until FY 2022, TCS had included only emissions from transportation of IT assets considering its relative significance compared to other supplies. While the Company continues to capture emissions from transportation of IT assets based on spend based emission factors, emissions related to transportation of non-IT supplies were included. The non – IT supplies covered to estimate category 4 emissions include cafeteria/ canteen supplies, water supplies through tankers, housekeeping material, and other stationary supplies. Emission factors are taken from DEFRA 2023 for the transport emissions based on vehicle type and weight. There is a significant decrease in this category as the actual data were taken from the locations in FY24 compared to FY23 which was based on pilot study at few locations. The Company has also moved the waste disposal related transport emissions from Category 4 to 5 in FY24.

Category 5: No change in approach in FY 2024. The emissions are based on disposal mechanisms (e.g., recycling, reuse, landfill) for different categories of waste (plastic, metal, e-waste, batteries, food waste, garden waste etc.,) and have been computed based on emission factors from DEFRA 2023. Slight increase in emission due to increased RTO and also due to inclusion of waste disposal related transportation under this category.

Category 6: In FY 2022, business travel included emissions from air and rail. In FY 2023 and FY 2024, business travel emissions also include hotel stays at various geographies during business travel. Relevant emission factors are taken from DEFRA 2023. There is an increase in emissions due to increase in business travel and accommodation due to resumption and RTO.

Category 7: In FY 2024, the employee commute related carbon emission includes those from TCS hired vehicles for transport of employees, personal employee commute, public employee commute &#x26; work from home (WFH) emissions. There is an increase in employee commute due to RTO in FY 2023-24 compared to previous year.

# Business Responsibility &#x26; Sustainability Report

In our opinion, the company’s Identified Sustainability Information on pages 127 to 166 of the Annual Report for the period 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024, subject to reasonable assurance is prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements (SEBI LODR) and basis of preparation set out in page 128 Section A: General Disclosures 13 of the Integrated Annual Report.

We do not express an assurance opinion on information in respect of any other information included in the Integrated Annual Report 2024 or linked from the Sustainability Information or from the Integrated Annual Report 2023, including any images, audio files or embedded videos.

# Basis for opinion

We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Our responsibilities” section of our report.

We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA).

Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements, issued by the IAASB. This standard requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management, including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Other information

Additionally, we have performed a limited assurance engagement on select BRSR and GRI indicators and issued an independent assurance report on 08 May 2024. Our report thereon is included with the other information.

Our reasonable assurance opinion on the ISI does not extend to other information that accompanies or contains the ‘ISI and our assurance report’ (hereafter referred to as “other information”). We have read the other information, but we have not performed any procedures with respect to the other information.

# Other matter

Select BRSR Core attributes of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2023 were assured by the previous assurance practitioner who had expressed an unmodified opinion on 09 June 2023. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

# Inherent limitations in preparing the ISI

The preparation of the company’s BRSR information requires the management to establish or interpret the criteria, make determinations about the relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported information.

Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core metrics, some of which are estimates, is subject to substantial inherent measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG emissions, water footprint, energy footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to support our opinion does not reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics.

# Our responsibilities

We are responsible for:

- Planning and performing the engagement to obtain reasonable assurance on the sustainability disclosures in the BRSR Core are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria in line with the section above.
- Forming an independent opinion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, and
- Reporting our reasonable assurance opinion to the Directors of Tata Consultancy Services Limited.

# Exclusions

Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we will not express an opinion on the same:

- Operations of the Company other than those mentioned in the “Scope of Assurance”.
- Aspects of the BRSR and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the ISI.
- Data and information outside the defined reporting period i.e., from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024.
- The statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim, or future intentions provided by the Company.

# Summary of the work we performed as the basis for our opinion

We exercised professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the engagement. We designed and performed our procedures to obtain evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable assurance opinion.

# Reasonable assurance opinion

The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depended on our judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the information subject to reasonable assurance, whether due to fraud or error. We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement through understanding the Information subject to reasonable assurance and the engagement circumstances. We also obtained an understanding of the internal control relevant to the information subject to reasonable assurance in order to

Consolidated Financial Statements

# Independent Auditor’s Report

To the Members of Tata Consultancy Services Limited

# Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

# Opinion

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited (hereinafter referred to as the “Holding Company”) and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as “the Group”), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2024, and the consolidated statement of profit and loss (including other comprehensive income), consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including material accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the consolidated financial statements”).

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at 31 March 2024, of its consolidated profit and other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the Act, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

# Key Audit Matter(s)

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# Revenue recognition– Fixed price contracts where revenue is recognized using percentage of completion method

See Note 5(a) and Note 12 to consolidated financial statements

The key audit matter: The Group inter alia engages in Fixed-price contracts, wherein, revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion computed as per the input method based on the Group’s estimate of contract costs. We identified revenue recognition of fixed price contracts where the percentage of completion is used as a key audit matter since there is an inherent risk and presumed fraud risk around the accuracy and existence of revenues recognised considering the customised and complex nature of these contracts and significant inputs of IT systems.

# How the matter was addressed in our audit

Our audit procedures included the following:

- Obtained an understanding of the systems, processes and controls implemented by the Group for recording and computing revenue and the associated contract assets, unearned and deferred revenue balances.
- Involvement of our Information technology(‘IT’) specialists, as required:
- Assessed the IT environment in which the business systems operate and tested system controls over computation of revenue recognised;
- Tested the IT controls over appropriateness of cost and revenue reports generated by the system;

# Key Audit Matter

# How the matter was addressed in our audit

- Application of revenue recognition accounting standard (Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts with customers) is complex and involves a number of key judgments and estimates in mainly identifying performance obligations, related transaction price and estimating the future cost-to-completion of these contracts, which is used to determine the percentage of completion of the relevant performance obligation;
- These contracts may involve onerous obligations which requires critical assessment of foreseeable losses to be made by the Group; and
- At year-end, significant amount of work in progress (Contract assets), related to these contracts are recognised on the balance sheet.

# On selected specific and statistical samples of contracts, we tested that the revenue recognized is in accordance with the revenue recognition accounting standard including –

- Evaluated the identification of performance obligations and the ascribed transaction price;
- For testing the Group’s computation of the estimation of contract costs and onerous obligations, if any. We:

# Other Information

The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Holding Company’s Annual report, but does not include the financial statements and auditor’s reports thereon. The Holding Company’s Annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.

Consolidated financial statements in term of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated state of affairs, consolidated profit/loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act. The respective Management and

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

# Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of each company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; the selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Management and Board of Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24

Consolidated Financial Statements

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Management and Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for assessing the ability of each company to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of each company.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of consolidated financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the consolidated financial statements.

(Referred to in paragraph 2A(g) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date)

# Opinion

In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited (hereinafter referred to as “the Holding Company”) as of and for the year ended 31 March 2024, we have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of the Holding Company and such companies incorporated in India under the Companies Act 2013, which are its subsidiary companies, as of that date.

In our opinion, the Holding Company and such companies incorporated in India which are its subsidiary companies, have, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and such internal financial controls were operating effectively as at 31 March 2024, based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by such companies considering the essential components of such internal controls stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “Guidance Note”).

# Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls

The respective Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by the respective company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.

# Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements.

# Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements

A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

# Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

# 1) Corporate information

Tata Consultancy Services Limited (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively together with employee welfare trusts referred to as “the Group”) provide IT services, consulting and business solutions and have been partnering with many of the world’s largest businesses in their transformation journeys. The Group offers a consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions. This is delivered through its unique Location-Independent Agile delivery model recognised as a benchmark of excellence in software development.

The functional currency of the Company and its Indian subsidiaries is the Indian Rupee (`). The functional currency of foreign subsidiaries is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Foreign currency transactions are recorded at exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet dates and exchange gains and losses arising on settlement and restatement are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not retranslated.

The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in India. The address of its corporate office is TCS House, Raveline Street, Fort, Mumbai- 400001. As at March 31, 2024, Tata Sons Private Limited, the holding company owned 71.74% of the Company’s equity share capital.

The Board of Directors approved the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 and authorised for issue on April 12, 2024.

# 2) Statement of compliance

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (referred to as “Ind AS”) prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to time.

The Company establishes control when; it has power over the entity, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect the entity’s returns by using its power over relevant activities of the entity. Entities controlled by the Company are consolidated from the date control commences until the date control ceases.

# 3) Basis of preparation

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured at fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. All assets and liabilities have been classified as current and non-current as per the Group’s normal operating cycle. Based on the nature of services rendered to customers and time elapsed between deployment of resources and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the consideration for such services rendered, the Group has considered an operating cycle of 12 months.

The statement of cash flows has been prepared under indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated. The Group considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value to be cash equivalents.

The results of subsidiaries acquired, or sold, during the year are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.

The financial statements of the Group companies are consolidated on a line-by-line basis and all inter-company transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation. Changes in the Company’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amount of the Company’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to shareholders of the Company.

Assets and liabilities of entities with functional currency other than the functional currency of the Company have been translated using exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Statement of profit and loss of such entities has been translated using weighted average exchange rates. Translation adjustments have been reported as foreign currency translation reserve in the statement of changes in equity. When a foreign operation is disposed off in its entirety or partially such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative

amount of exchange differences related to that foreign operation recognised in OCI is reclassified to statement of profit and loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.

# 5) Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with the recognition and measurement principles of Ind AS requires management of the Group to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent liabilities as at the date of consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the periods presented. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected.

The Group uses the following critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions in preparation of its consolidated financial statements:

# (a) Revenue recognition

Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using percentage-of-completion method. The Group estimates the future cost-to-completion of the contracts which is used to determine degree of completion of the performance obligation. The Group exercises judgement for identification of performance obligations, determination of transaction price, ascribing the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation and in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period of time. These judgements have been explained in detail under the revenue recognition note (Refer note 12).

# (b) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment

The Group reviews the useful life of property, plant and equipment at the end of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation expense in future periods (Refer note 10(a)).

# (c) Impairment of goodwill

The Group estimates the value-in-use of the cash generating units (CGUs) based on the future cash flows after considering current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results and growth rate and anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions. The estimated cash flows are developed using internal forecasts. The discount rates used for the CGUs represent the weighted average cost of capital based on the historical market returns of comparable companies (Refer note 10(b)).

# (d) Fair value measurement of financial instruments

When the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

# (e) Impairment of financial assets (other than at fair value)

Measurement of impairment of financial assets require use of estimates, which have been explained in the note on financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments, under impairment of financial assets (other than at fair value) (Refer note 8).

# (f) Provision for income tax and deferred tax assets

The Group uses judgements based on the relevant rulings in the areas of allocation of revenue, costs, allowances and disallowances which is exercised while determining the provision for income tax. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised. Accordingly, the Group exercises its judgement to reassess the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period.

# (g) Provisions and contingent liabilities

The Group estimates the provisions that have present obligations as a result of past events and it is probable that outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. The Group uses significant judgements to assess contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.

# (h) Employee benefits

The accounting of employee benefit plans in the nature of defined benefit requires the Group to use assumptions. These assumptions have been explained under employee benefits note (Refer note 14).

Consolidated Financial Statements 2023-24

# Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements

# (i) Leases

The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. Identification of a lease requires significant judgement. The Group uses significant judgement in assessing the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate.

The Group determines the lease term as the noncancellable period of a lease, together with both periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Group is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. In assessing whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a lease, it considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Group to exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease. The Group revises the lease term if there is a change in the noncancellable period of a lease.

The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.

# 8) Financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured on initial recognition of financial asset or financial liability.

The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired.

# Cash and cash equivalents

The Group considers all highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.

# 7) Business combinations

The Group accounts for its business combinations under acquisition method of accounting. Acquisition related costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the condition for recognition are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.

Purchase consideration paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Where the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities exceed the cost of acquisition, after reassessing the fair values of the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is recognised as capital reserve.

# Financial assets at amortised cost

Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

# Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income

The interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the.

Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and selling financial assets.

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24

Consolidated Financial Statements 2023-24

# Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements

The Group has made an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of equity investments not held for trading in other comprehensive income.

# Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are immediately recognised in statement of profit and loss.

The effective portion of change in the fair value of the designated hedging instrument is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading cash flow hedging reserve.

The Group separates the intrinsic value and time value of an option and designates as hedging instruments only the change in intrinsic value of the option. The change in fair value of the intrinsic value and time value of an option is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accounted as a separate component of equity. Such amounts are reclassified into the statement of profit and loss when the related hedged items affect profit and loss. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity till that time remains and is recognised in statement of profit and loss when the forecasted transaction ultimately affects profit and loss. Any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss when the hedge becomes ineffective.

# Derivative accounting

# Instruments in hedging relationship

The Group designates certain foreign exchange forward, currency options and futures contracts as hedge instruments in respect of foreign exchange risks. These hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

The Group uses hedging instruments that are governed by the financial risk management policy as approved by the Risk Management Committee. The policy provides principles on the use of such financial derivatives consistent with the risk management strategy of the company and its subsidiaries. While determining the appropriate hedge ratio, the Group takes into consideration the prevailing macro-economic conditions, the availability and liquidity of the hedging instruments, tolerance levels for hedge ineffectiveness and the costs of hedging. The hedging activities are reviewed by the Risk Management Committee every quarter and future course of action is determined.

# Instruments not in hedging relationship

The Group enters into contracts that are effective as hedges from an economic perspective, but they do not qualify for hedge accounting. The change in the fair value of such instrument is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

# Impairment of financial assets (other than at fair value)

The Group assesses at each date of balance sheet whether a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. Ind AS 109 requires expected credit losses to be measured through a loss allowance. The Group recognises lifetime expected losses for all contract assets and/or all trade receivables that do not constitute a financing transaction.

In determining the allowance for expected credit losses, the Group has used a practical expedient by computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward looking information. The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and allowance rates used in the provision matrix. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-months expected credit losses or at an amount equal to the life time expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition.

Loans include inter-corporate deposits of `1,016 crore, with original maturity period within 24 months.

Carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans and trade payables as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, approximate the fair value due to their nature. Carrying amounts of bank deposits, earmarked balances with banks, other financial assets and other financial liabilities which are subsequently measured at amortised cost also approximate the fair value due to their nature in each of the periods presented. Fair value measurement of lease liabilities is not required. Fair value of investments carried at amortised cost is `1,215 crore and `5,587 crore as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

# (j) Fair value hierarchy

The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable and consists of the following three levels:

- Level 1 — Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 — Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3 — Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.

The cost of unquoted investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy approximate their fair value because there is a wide range of possible fair value measurements and the cost represents estimate of fair value within that range.

# (k) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activity

The Group’s revenue is denominated in various foreign currencies. Given the nature of the business, a large portion of the costs are denominated in Indian Rupee. This exposes the Group to currency fluctuations.

The Board of Directors has constituted a Risk Management Committee (RMC) to frame, implement and monitor the risk management plan of the Group which inter-alia covers risks arising out of exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Under the guidance and framework provided by the RMC, the Group uses various derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward, currency options and futures contracts in which the counter party is generally a bank.

# Financial Risk Management

The Group is exposed primarily to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, which may adversely impact the fair value of its financial instruments. The Group has a risk management policy which covers risks associated with the financial assets and liabilities. The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors. The focus of the risk management committee is to assess the unpredictability of the financial environment and to mitigate potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group.

# Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements

# Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit, liquidity and other market changes. The Group’s exposure to market risk is primarily on account of foreign currency exchange rate risk.

# • Foreign currency exchange rate risk

The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets / liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective entities. Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Group operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries.

The Group, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange. Further, any movement in the functional currencies of the various operations of the Group against major foreign currencies may impact the Group’s revenue in international business.

The Group evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks. It hedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management policies.

The foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure and a simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the respective functional currencies of Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries.

The following analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures for each of the subsidiaries and Tata Consultancy Services Limited as of the date of balance sheet which could affect the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income and equity. Further the exposure as indicated below is mitigated by some of the derivative contracts entered into by the Group as disclosed in note 8(k).

# The following table sets forth information relating to unhedged foreign currency exposure as at March 31, 2024:

|                           | USD     | EUR   | GBP     | Others |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ------- | ------ |
| Net financial assets      | 2,753   | 518   | 161     | 3,508  |
| Net financial liabilities | (7,129) | (253) | (2,185) | (753)  |

10% appreciation / depreciation of the respective functional currency of Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries with respect to various foreign currencies would result in increase / decrease in the Group’s profit before taxes by approximately `338 crore for the year ended March 31, 2024.

# The following table sets forth information relating to unhedged foreign currency exposure as at March 31, 2023:

|                           | USD      | EUR   | GBP     | Others |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ----- | ------- | ------ |
| Net financial assets      | 3,869    | 262   | 90      | 2,136  |
| Net financial liabilities | (11,021) | (657) | (1,536) | (270)  |

10% appreciation / depreciation of the respective functional currency of Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries with respect to various foreign currencies would result in increase / decrease in the Group’s profit before taxes by approximately `713 crore for the year ended March 31, 2023.

# • Interest rate risk

The Group’s investments are primarily in fixed rate interest bearing investments. Hence, the Group is not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.

# Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the contractual terms or obligations. Credit risk encompasses both the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of customers on a continuous basis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit. Refer note 5 for methods, assumptions and information used to measure expected credit losses.

Financial instruments that are subject to credit risk consist of trade receivables, loans, investments, derivative financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and other financial assets. Inter-corporate deposits of `170 crore are with a financial institution having a high credit-rating assigned by credit-rating agencies. Bank deposits include an amount of `5,197 crore held with two banks having high credit rating which are individually in excess of 10% or more of the Group’s total bank deposits as at March 31, 2024. None of the other financial instruments of the Group result in material concentration of credit risk.

# Exposure to credit risk

The carrying amount of financial assets and contract assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk was `2,96,130 crore and `1,09,258 crore as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, being the total of the carrying amount of balances with banks, bank deposits, investments, trade receivables, loans, contract assets and other financial assets.

The Group’s exposure to customers is diversified and no single customer contributes to more than 10% of outstanding trade receivables and contract assets as at March 31, 2024 and 2023.

# Geographic concentration of credit risk

Geographic concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is as follows:

# 9) Leases

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

# Group as a lessee

The Group accounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from non-lease components of the contract and allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative standalone price of the lease component and the aggregate standalone price of the non-lease components.

The Group recognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease commencement date. The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24

# Consolidated Financial Statements 2023-24

# Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements

The Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably similar characteristics, the Group, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable lease payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Group recognises the amount of the re-measurement of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of profit and loss depending upon the nature of modification. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Group recognises any remaining amount of the re-measurement in statement of profit and loss.

The Group has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116- Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

# Group as a lessor

At the inception of the lease the Group classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The Group recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In case of a finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net investment in the lease. When the Group is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.

If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group applies Ind AS 115- Revenue from contracts with customers to allocate the consideration in the contract.

# The details of the right-of-use assets held by the Group is as follows:

# 10) Non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities

# (a) Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost comprising of purchase price and any initial directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use, less accumulated depreciation (other than freehold land) and impairment loss, if any.

Depreciation is provided for property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis so as to expense the cost less residual value over their estimated useful lives as prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except in respect of certain categories of assets, where the useful life of the assets has been assessed based on a technical evaluation. The estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any change in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.

The estimated useful lives are as mentioned below:

| Type of asset            | Useful lives |
| ------------------------ | ------------ |
| Buildings                | 20 years\*   |
| Leasehold improvements   | Lease term   |
| Plant and equipment      | 10 years\*   |
| Computer equipment       | 4 years\*    |
| Vehicles                 | 4 years\*    |
| Office equipment         | 2-5 years\*  |
| Electrical installations | 4-10 years\* |
| Furniture and fixtures   | 5 years\*    |

* The Group believes that the technically evaluated useful lives, different from Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, best represent the period over which these assets are expected to be used.

Depreciation is not recorded on capital work-in-progress until construction and installation are complete and the asset is ready for its intended use.

Property, plant and equipment with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

# (b) Goodwill

Goodwill represents the cost of acquired business as established at the date of acquisition of the business in excess of the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount.

CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is indication for impairment. The financial projections basis which the future cash flows have been estimated consider economic uncertainties, reassessment of the discount rates, revisiting the growth rates factored while arriving at terminal value and subjecting these variables to sensitivity analysis. If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.

Goodwill consists of the following:

|                                        | As at March 31, 2024 | As at March 31, 2023 |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Balance at the beginning of the period | 1,858                | 1,787                |
| Translation exchange difference        | (26)                 | 71                   |
| Balance at the end of the period       | 1,832                | 1,858                |

Goodwill of `689 crore and `685 crore as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, has been allocated to the TCS business in France. The estimated value-in-use of this CGU is based on the future cash flows using a 1.50% annual growth rate for periods subsequent to the forecast period of 5 years and discount rate of 8.67%. An analysis of the sensitivity of the computation to a change in key parameters (operating margin, discount rates and long term average growth rate), based on reasonable assumptions, did not identify any probable scenario in which the recoverable amount of the CGU would decrease below its carrying amount.

The remaining amount of goodwill of `1,143 crore and `1,173 crore as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, (relating to different CGUs individually immaterial) has been evaluated based on the cash flow forecasts of the related CGUs and the recoverable amounts of these CGUs exceeded their carrying amounts.

# Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements

# (c) Other intangible assets

Intangible assets purchased including acquired in business combination, are measured at cost as at the date of acquisition, as applicable, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment, if any.

Intangible assets consist of rights under licensing agreement and software licences and customer-related intangibles.

# Following table summarises the nature of intangibles and their estimated useful lives:

| Type of asset                                          | Useful lives                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Rights under licensing agreement and software licences | Lower of licence period and 2-5 years |
| Customer-related intangibles                           | 3 years                               |

Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of its economic useful life. Intangible assets with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

# 12) Revenue recognition

The Group earns revenue primarily from providing IT services, consulting and business solutions. The Group offers a consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions.

Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Group expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.

- Revenue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on output basis measured by units delivered, efforts expended, number of transactions processed, etc.
- Revenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts where the Group is standing ready to provide services is recognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight lined over the period of performance.
- In respect of other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognised using percentage-of-completion method (‘POC method’) of accounting with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of the performance obligation. The contract costs used in computing the revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.
- Revenue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and manufactured systems and third party software is recognised upfront at the point in time when the system/software is delivered to the customer. In cases where implementation and/or customisation services rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services and software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognised over time on a POC method.
- Revenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer.
- The solutions offered by the Group may include supply of third-party equipment or software. In such cases, revenue for supply of such third party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether the Group is acting as the principal or as an agent of the customer. The Group recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration when it is acting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.

Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue also excludes taxes collected from customers.

The Group’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. The Group assesses the products/services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables.

Judgement is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation. The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable consideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant financing component. Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for a distinct product or service from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Group allocates the elements of variable considerations to all the performance obligations of the contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct performance obligations.

The Group exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period of time. The Group considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered or who controls the asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of such product or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.

Contract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for capitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The assessment of this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.

# Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements

Contract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified as unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms.

Unearned and deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.

The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance based payments and / or milestone based progress payments. Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.

In accordance with Ind AS 37, the Group recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.

Contracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Group reviews modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In the event transaction price is revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.

The Group disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature of services, industry verticals and geography.

# Revenue disaggregation by nature of services is as follows:

|                                         | Year ended March 31, 2024 | Year ended March 31, 2023 |

| Consultancy services                    | 2,38,135                  | 2,23,332                  |
| Sale of equipment and software licences | 2,758                     | 2,126                     |
| Total                                   | 2,40,893                  | 2,25,458                  |

Revenue disaggregation by industry vertical and geography has been included in segment information (Refer note 19).

While disclosing the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognise those revenues, the Group has applied the practical expedient in Ind AS 115. Accordingly, the Group has not disclosed the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations which pertain to contracts where revenue recognised corresponds to the value transferred to customer typically involving time and material, outcome based and event based contracts.

Unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations are subject to variability due to several factors such as terminations, changes in scope of contracts, periodic revalidations of the estimates, economic factors (changes in currency rates, tax laws etc). The aggregate value of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations is `1,65,314 crore out of which 47.69% is expected to be recognised as revenue in the next year and the balance thereafter. No consideration from contracts with customers is excluded from the amount mentioned above.

# 14) Employee benefits

# Defined benefit plans

For defined benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Past service cost, both vested and unvested, is recognised as an expense at the earlier of (a) when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs; and (b) when the entity recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits.

The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.

The Group provides benefits such as gratuity, pension and provident fund (Company managed fund) to its employees which are treated as defined benefit plans.

# Defined contribution plans

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to such benefits.

The Group provides benefits such as superannuation, provident fund (other than Company managed fund) and foreign defined contribution plans to its employees which are treated as defined contribution plans.

# Short-term employee benefits

All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short-term employee benefits. Benefits such as salaries, wages etc. and the expected cost of ex-gratia are recognised in the period in which the employee renders the related service. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid when there is a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

# Compensated absences

Compensated absences which are expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related services are recognised as undiscounted liability at the balance sheet date. Compensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related services are recognised as an actuarially determined liability at the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date using the Projected Unit Credit Method.

# Employee benefit expenses consist of the following:

# Employee benefit plans consist of the following:

# Gratuity and pension

In accordance with Indian law, Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries in India operate a scheme of gratuity which is a defined benefit plan. The gratuity plan provides for a lump sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death while in employment or on termination of employment of an amount equivalent to 15 to 30 days’ salary payable for each completed year of service. Vesting occurs upon completion of five continuous years of service. The Company manages the plan through a trust. Trustees administer contributions made to the trust. Certain overseas subsidiaries of the Company also provide for retirement benefit pension plans in accordance with the local laws.

The assumptions used in accounting for the defined benefit plan are set out below:

| Weighted average duration of defined benefit obligations     | 2-11 Years                | 3-27 Years    | 2-13 Years                | 3-28 Years    |   |   |

Future mortality assumptions are taken based on the published statistics by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India.

The expected benefits are based on the same assumptions as are used to measure Group’s defined benefit plan obligations as at March 31, 2024. The Group is expected to contribute `40 crore to defined benefit plan obligations funds for the year ending March 31, 2025 comprising domestic component of `8 crore and foreign component of `32 crore.

The significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligations are discount rate and expected salary increase. The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.

If the discount rate increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows:

|                   | As at March 31, 2024 | As at March 31, 2023 |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Increase of 0.50% | (272)                | (265)                |
| Decrease of 0.50% | 300                  | 290                  |

If the expected salary growth increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows:

|                   | As at March 31, 2024 | As at March 31, 2023 |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Increase of 0.50% | 163                  | 155                  |
| Decrease of 0.50% | (157)                | (147)                |

The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligations as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.

Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligations has been calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the balance sheet.

Each year an Asset-Liability matching study is performed in which the consequences of the strategic investment policies are analysed in terms of risk and return profiles. Investment and contribution policies are integrated within this study.

# Provident fund

In accordance with Indian law, all eligible employees of Tata Consultancy Services Limited in India are entitled to receive benefits under the provident fund plan in which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to a trust set up by the Company to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees. This plan is a defined benefit plan as the Company is obligated to provide its members a rate of return which should, at the minimum, meet the interest rate declared by Government administered provident fund. A part of the Company’s contribution is transferred to Government administered pension fund. The contributions made by the Company and the shortfall of interest, if any, are recognised as an expense in profit and loss under employee benefit expenses. In accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund liabilities on the basis of guidance issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions as mentioned below, there is no deficiency in the interest cost as the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than the expected amount to be credited to the individual members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of Government administered provident fund.

All eligible employees of Indian subsidiaries of the Company are entitled to receive benefits under the provident fund plan in which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to the Government administered provident fund plan. A part of the Company’s contribution is transferred to Government administered pension fund. This plan is a defined contribution plan as the obligation of the employer is limited to the monthly contributions made to the fund. The contributions made to the fund are recognised as an expense in profit and loss under employee benefit expenses.

The details of fund and plan assets are given below:

| As at                                        | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2023 |

# 17) Income taxes

Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the year. Current and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

# Current income taxes

The current income tax expense includes income taxes payable by the Company and its subsidiaries in India and overseas. The current tax payable by the Company and its subsidiaries in India is Indian income tax payable on income after taking credit for tax relief available for export operations in Special Economic Zones (SEZs).

The current income tax payable by overseas branches of the Company is computed in accordance with the tax laws applicable in the jurisdiction in which the respective branch operates. The taxes paid are generally available for set off against the Indian income tax liability of the Company’s worldwide income.

The current income tax expense for overseas subsidiaries has been computed based on the tax laws applicable to each subsidiary in the respective jurisdiction in which it operates.

Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax paid and income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying unit intends to settle the asset and liability on a net basis.

# Deferred income taxes

Deferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount, except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.

Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be received or settled.

For operations carried out in SEZs, deferred tax assets or liabilities, if any, have been established for the tax consequences of those temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases that reverse after the tax holiday ends.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the relevant entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

# Consolidated Financial Statements 2023-24

# Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements

Deferred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, to the extent it would be available for set off against future current income tax liability. Accordingly, MAT is recognised as deferred tax asset in the balance sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will be realised.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets relate primarily to business losses and tax credit entitlements which do not qualify for recognition as per the applicable accounting standards. These unabsorbed business losses will expire based on the year of origination as follows:

| March 31,  | Unabsorbed business losses |
| ---------- | -------------------------- |
| 2027       | 1                          |
| 2028       | -                          |
| Thereafter | 39                         |

Under the Income-tax Act, 1961, Tata Consultancy Services Limited is liable to pay Minimum Alternate Tax in the tax holiday period. MAT paid can be carried forward for a period of 15 years and can be set off against the future tax liabilities. MAT is recognised as a deferred tax asset only when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will be realised.

Deferred tax liability on temporary differences of `7,473 crore as at March 31, 2024, associated with investments in subsidiaries, has not been recognised, as it is the intention of Tata Consultancy Services Limited to reinvest the earnings of these subsidiaries for the foreseeable future.

# Direct tax contingencies

The Company and its subsidiaries have ongoing disputes with income tax authorities in India and in some of the other jurisdictions where they operate. The disputes relate to tax treatment of certain expenses claimed as deduction, computation or eligibility of tax incentives and allowances and characterisation of fees for services received. Contingent liability in respect of tax demands received from direct tax authorities in India and other jurisdictions is `1,871 crore and `1,542 crore as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These demand orders are being contested by the Company and its subsidiaries based on the management evaluation and advise of tax consultants. In respect of tax contingencies of `318 crore and `318 crore as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, not included above, the Company is entitled to an indemnification from the seller of TCS e-Serve Limited.

The Group periodically receives notices and inquiries from income tax authorities related to the Group’s operations in the jurisdictions it operates in. The Group has evaluated these notices and inquiries and has concluded that any consequent income tax claims or demands by the income tax authorities will not succeed on ultimate resolution.

The number of years that are subject to tax assessments varies depending on tax jurisdiction. The major tax jurisdictions of Tata Consultancy Services Limited include India, United States of America and United Kingdom. In India, tax filings from fiscal 2022 are generally subject to examination by the tax authorities. In United States of America, the federal statute of limitation applies to fiscals 2020 and earlier and applicable state statutes of limitation vary by state. In United Kingdom, the statute of limitation generally applies to fiscal 2019 and earlier.

# 18) Earnings per share

# 19) Segment information

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. The Group’s chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director.

The Group has identified business segments (‘industry vertical’) as reportable segments. The business segments comprise:

1. Banking, Financial Services and Insurance
2. Manufacturing
3. Consumer Business
4. Communication, Media and Technology
5. Life Sciences and Healthcare
6. Others such as Energy, Resources and Utilities, e-Governance and Products

Revenue and expenses directly attributable to segments are reported under each reportable segment. Expenses which are not directly identifiable to each reporting segment have been allocated on the basis of associated revenue of the segment. All other expenses which are not attributable or allocable to segments have been disclosed as unallocable expenses.

The assets and liabilities of the Group are used interchangeably amongst segments. Allocation of such assets and liabilities is not practicable and any forced allocation would not result in any meaningful segregation. Hence assets and liabilities have not been identified to any of the reportable segments.

# Summarised segment information for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, is as follows:

Standalone Financial Statements

# Key Audit Matter

Application of revenue recognition accounting standard (Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts with customers) is complex and involves a number of key judgments and estimates in mainly identifying performance obligations, related transaction price and estimating the future cost-to-completion of these contracts, which is used to determine the percentage of completion of the relevant performance obligation;
These contracts may involve onerous obligations which requires critical assessment of foreseeable losses to be made by the Company;
At year-end, significant amount of work in progress (Contract assets), related to these contracts are recognised on the balance sheet.

# How the Matter Was Addressed in Our Audit

Tested on a random sampling basis the controls relating to the estimation of contract costs required to complete the respective projects.
On selected specific and statistical samples of contracts, we tested that the revenue recognized is in accordance with the revenue recognition accounting standard including –
Evaluated the identification of performance obligations and the ascribed transaction price;
For testing the Company’s computation of the estimation of contract costs and onerous obligations, if any. We:
Assessed that the estimates of costs to complete were reviewed and approved by appropriate designated management personnel;
Performed a retrospective analysis of costs incurred with estimated costs to identify significant variations and challenged whether those variations are required to be considered in estimating the remaining costs to complete the contract;
Assessed the appropriateness of work in progress (contract assets) on balance sheet date by evaluating the underlying documentation to identify possible changes in estimated costs to complete the remaining performance obligations;
Inspected underlying documents and performed analytics to determine reasonableness of contract costs.

# Other Information

The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Company’s annual report, but does not include the financial statements and auditor’s report(s) thereon. The Company’s annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.

Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

# Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the Standalone Financial Statements

The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit/loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the standalone financial statements, the Management and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.

Standalone Financial Statements

# Standalone Financial Statements

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of standalone financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Standalone Financial Statements

# Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on the standalone financial statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited for the year ended 31 March 2024

# Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid standalone financial statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act

(Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(g) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date)

# Opinion

We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited (“the Company”) as of 31 March 2024 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.

In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and such internal financial controls were operating effectively as at 31 March 2024, based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “Guidance Note”).

# Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls

The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.

# Auditors’ Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements.

# Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements

A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

# Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

# 1) Corporate information

Tata Consultancy Services Limited (referred to as “TCS Limited” or “the Company”) provides IT services, consulting and business solutions and has been partnering with many of the world’s largest businesses in their transformation journeys. The Company offers a consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions. This is delivered through its unique Location-Independent Agile delivery model recognised as a benchmark of excellence in software development. The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in India. The address of its corporate office is TCS House, Raveline Street, Fort, Mumbai- 400001. As at March 31, 2024, Tata Sons Private Limited, the holding company owned 71.74% of the Company’s equity share capital. The Board of Directors approved the standalone financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 and authorised for issue on April 12, 2024.

# 2) Statement of compliance

These standalone financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (referred to as “Ind AS”) as prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to time.

# 3) Basis of preparation

These standalone financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured at fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. All assets and liabilities have been classified as current and non-current as per the Company’s normal operating cycle. Based on the nature of services rendered to customers and time elapsed between deployment of resources and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the consideration for such services rendered, the Company has considered an operating cycle of 12 months. The statement of cash flows has been prepared under indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated. The Company considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value to be cash equivalents. These standalone financial statements have been prepared in Indian Rupee (`) which is the functional currency of the Company.

# 4) Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of standalone financial statements in conformity with the recognition and measurement principles of Ind AS requires management of the Company to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent liabilities as at the date of standalone financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the periods presented. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected.

The Company uses the following critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions in preparation of its standalone financial statements:

# (a) Revenue recognition

Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using percentage-of-completion method. The Company estimates the future cost-to-completion of the contracts which is used to determine degree of completion of the performance obligation. The Company exercises judgement for identification of performance obligations, determination of transaction price, ascribing the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation and in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period of time. These judgements have been explained in detail under the revenue note (Refer note 10).

# (b) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment

The Company reviews the useful life of property, plant and equipment at the end of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation expense in future periods (Refer note 8(a)).

# (c) Impairment of investments in subsidiaries

The Company reviews its carrying value of investments carried at cost (net of impairment, if any) annually, or more frequently when there is indication for impairment. If the recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is accounted for in the statement of profit and loss.

# (d) Fair value measurement of financial instruments

# (i) Leases

When the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

# (e) Impairment of financial assets (other than at fair value)

Measurement of impairment of financial assets require use of estimates, which have been explained in the note on financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments, under impairment of financial assets (other than at fair value) (Refer note 6).

# (f) Provision for income tax and deferred tax assets

The Company uses judgements based on the relevant rulings in the areas of allocation of revenue, costs, allowances and disallowances which is exercised while determining the provision for income tax. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised. Accordingly, the Company exercises its judgement to reassess the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period.

# (g) Provisions and contingent liabilities

The Company estimates the provisions that have present obligations as a result of past events and it is probable that outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. The Company uses significant judgements to assess contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the standalone financial statements.

# (h) Employee benefits

The accounting of employee benefit plans in the nature of defined benefit requires the Company to use assumptions. These assumptions have been explained under employee benefits note (Refer note 12).

# 5) Recent pronouncements

Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standards or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. For the year ended March 31, 2024, MCA has not notified any new standards or amendments to the existing standards applicable to the Company.

# 6) Financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured on initial recognition of financial asset or financial liability. The Company derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired.

# Cash and cash equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value, to be cash.

258 Standalone Financial Statements 2023-24

# Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements

# Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.

# Financial Assets at Amortised Cost

Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

# Financial Assets at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income

Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and selling financial assets. The Company has made an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of equity investments not held for trading in other comprehensive income.

# Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss

Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are immediately recognised in statement of profit and loss.

# Investment in Subsidiaries

Investment in subsidiaries are measured at cost less impairment loss, if any.

# Financial Liabilities

Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

# Equity Instruments

An equity instrument is a contract that evidences residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognised at the proceeds received net of direct issue cost.

# Derivative Accounting

# Instruments in Hedging Relationship

The Company designates certain foreign exchange forward, currency options and futures contracts as hedge instruments in respect of foreign exchange risks. These hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The Company uses hedging instruments that are governed by the financial risk management policy as approved by the Risk Management Committee. The policy provides principles on the use of such financial derivatives consistent with the risk management strategy of the Company. While determining the appropriate hedge ratio, the Company takes into consideration the prevailing macro-economic conditions, the availability and liquidity of the hedging instruments, tolerance levels for hedge ineffectiveness and the costs of hedging. The hedging activities are reviewed by the Risk Management Committee every quarter and future course of action is determined. The hedge instruments are designated and documented as hedges at the inception of the contract. The Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows. The effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce the risk associated with the exposure being hedged is assessed and measured at inception and on an ongoing basis. If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in other equity are immediately reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in the statement of profit and loss. The effective portion of change in the fair value of the designated hedging instrument is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading cash flow hedging reserve. The Company separates the intrinsic value and time value of an option and designates as hedging instruments only the change in intrinsic value of the option. The change in fair value of the intrinsic value and time value of an option is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accounted as a separate component of equity. Such amounts are reclassified into the statement of profit and loss when the related hedged items affect profit and loss. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity till that time remains and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the forecasted transaction ultimately affects profit and loss. Any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss when the hedge becomes ineffective.

# Instruments Not in Hedging Relationship

The Company enters into contracts that are effective as hedges from an economic perspective, but they do not qualify for hedge accounting. The change in the fair value of such instrument is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

# Impairment of Financial Assets (Other than at Fair Value)

The Company assesses at each date of balance sheet whether a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. Ind AS 109 requires expected credit losses to be measured through a loss allowance. The Company recognises lifetime expected losses for all contract assets and / or all trade receivables that do not constitute a

financing transaction. In determining the allowance for expected credit losses, the Company has used a practical expedient by computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward looking information. The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and allowance rates used in the provision matrix. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-months expected credit losses or at an amount equal to the life time expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition.

Carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans and trade payables as at March 31, 2024 and 2023, approximate the fair value due to their nature. Carrying amounts of bank deposits, earmarked balances with banks, other financial assets and other financial liabilities which are subsequently measured at amortised cost also approximate the fair value due to their nature in each of the periods presented. Fair value measurement of lease liabilities is not required. Fair value of investments carried at amortised cost is `940 crore and `5,351 crore as at March 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively.

# (k) Fair value hierarchy

The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable and consists of the following three levels:

- Level 1 – Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 – Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3 – Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.

The cost of unquoted investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy approximate their fair value because there is a wide range of possible fair value measurements and the cost represents estimate of fair value within that range.

# (l) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activity

The Company’s revenue is denominated in various foreign currencies. Given the nature of the business, a large portion of the costs are denominated in Indian Rupee. This exposes the Company to currency fluctuations.

The Board of Directors has constituted a Risk Management Committee (RMC) to frame, implement and monitor the risk management plan of the Company which inter-alia covers risks arising out of exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Under the guidance and framework provided by the RMC, the Company uses various derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward, currency options and futures contracts in which the counter party is generally a bank.

The Company has entered into derivative instruments not in hedging relationship by way of foreign exchange forward, currency options and futures contracts. As at March 31, 2024 and 2023, the notional amount of outstanding contracts aggregated to `49,180 crore and `46,102 crore, respectively, and the respective fair value of these contracts have a net loss of `42 crore and gain of `12 crore.

Exchange gain of `30 crore and loss of `1,159 crore on foreign exchange forward, currency options and futures contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting have been recognised in the standalone statement of profit and loss for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Net foreign exchange gain / (loss) include loss of `102 crore and `112 crore transferred from cash flow hedging reserve to profit and loss on occurrence of forecasted hedge transactions for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Net loss on derivative instruments of `9 crore recognised in cash flow hedging reserve as at March 31, 2024, is expected to be transferred to the statement of profit and loss by March 31, 2025. The maximum period over which the exposure to cash flow variability has been hedged is through calendar year 2024.

# (m) Financial risk management

The Company is exposed primarily to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, which may adversely impact the fair value of its financial instruments. The Company has a risk management policy which covers risks associated with the financial assets and liabilities. The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors. The focus of the risk management committee is to assess the unpredictability of the financial environment and to mitigate potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Company.

# Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit, liquidity and other market changes. The Company’s exposure to market risk is primarily on account of foreign currency exchange rate risk.

# • Foreign currency exchange rate risk

The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the statement of profit and loss and other
comprehensive income and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets / liabilities
are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company. Considering the countries and economic
environment in which the Company operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in
those countries.

The Company, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange. Further,
any movement in the functional currency of the various operations of the Company against major foreign currencies may
impact the Company’s revenue in international business.

The Company evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks. It
hedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management policies.

The foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure and a
simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the functional currency of the
Company.

The following analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures of the Company as of the date of balance sheet
which could affect the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income and equity. Further the exposure as
indicated below is mitigated by some of the derivative contracts entered into by the Company as disclosed in note 6(l).

# The following table sets forth information relating to unhedged foreign currency exposure as at March 31, 2024:

|                           | USD      | EUR   | GBP     | Others  |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ----- | ------- | ------- |
| Net financial assets      | 4,243    | 507   | 379     | 2,143   |
| Net financial liabilities | (11,238) | (760) | (2,215) | (1,530) |

10% appreciation / depreciation of the functional currency of the Company with respect to various foreign currencies would
result in increase / decrease in the Company’s profit before taxes by approximately `847 crore for the year ended
March 31, 2024.

# The following table sets forth information relating to unhedged foreign currency exposure as at March 31, 2023:

|                           | USD      | EUR   | GBP     | Others  |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ----- | ------- | ------- |
| Net financial assets      | 2,747    | 91    | 436     | 2,736   |
| Net financial liabilities | (12,419) | (723) | (1,923) | (1,108) |

10% appreciation / depreciation of the functional currency of the Company with respect to various foreign currencies would
result in increase / decrease in the Company’s profit before taxes by approximately `1,016 crore for the year ended
March 31, 2023.

# • Interest rate risk

The Company’s investments are primarily in fixed rate interest bearing investments. Hence, the Company is not significantly
exposed to interest rate risk.

# Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the contractual terms
or obligations. Credit risk encompasses of both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well
as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of customers on a continuous
basis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit. Refer note 4 for methods, assumptions
and information used to measure expected credit losses.

Financial instruments that are subject to credit risk consist of trade receivables, loans, investments, derivative financial
instruments, cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and other financial assets. Bank deposits include an amount of `2,500
crore held with two banks having high credit rating which are individually in excess of 10% or more of the Company’s total bank
deposits as at March 31, 2024. None of the other financial instruments of the Company result in material concentration of credit
risk.

# 7) Leases

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

Company as a lessee

The Company accounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from non-lease components of the contract and allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative standalone price of the lease component and the aggregate standalone price of the non-lease components.

The Company recognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease commencement date. The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

The Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably similar characteristics, the Company, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable lease payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Company recognises the amount of the re-measurement of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of profit and loss depending upon the nature of modification. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Company recognises any remaining amount of the re-measurement in statement of profit and loss.

The Company has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116- Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value.

# Company as a lessor

At the inception of the lease the Company classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The Company recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In case of a finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net investment in the lease. When the Company is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Company applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.

If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Company applies Ind AS 115- Revenue from contracts with customers to allocate the consideration in the contract.

# 8) Non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities

# (a) Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost comprising of purchase price and any initial directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use, less accumulated depreciation (other than freehold land) and impairment loss, if any.

Depreciation is provided for property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis so as to expense the cost less residual value over their estimated useful lives as prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except in respect of certain categories of assets, where the useful life of the assets has been assessed based on a technical evaluation. The estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any change in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.

The estimated useful lives are as mentioned below:

| Type of asset            | Useful lives |
| ------------------------ | ------------ |
| Buildings                | 20 years\*   |
| Leasehold improvements   | Lease term   |
| Plant and equipment      | 10 years\*   |
| Computer equipment       | 4 years\*    |
| Vehicles                 | 4 years\*    |
| Office equipment         | 2-5 years\*  |
| Electrical installations | 4-10 years\* |
| Furniture and fixtures   | 5 years\*    |

* The Company believes that the technically evaluated useful lives, different from Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, best represent the period over which these assets are expected to be used.

Depreciation is not recorded on capital work-in-progress until construction and installation are complete and the asset is ready for its intended use.

Property, plant and equipment with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

# (b) Intangible assets

Intangible assets purchased are measured at cost as at the date of acquisition, as applicable, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment, if any.

Intangible assets consist of rights under licensing agreement and software licences which are amortised over licence period which equates the economic useful life ranging between 2-5 years on a straight-line basis over the period of its economic useful life.

Intangible assets with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

Intangible assets consist of the following:

# 10) Revenue recognition

The Company earns revenue primarily from providing IT services, consulting and business solutions. The Company offers a consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions.

Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.

- Revenue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on output basis measured by units delivered, efforts expended, number of transactions processed, etc.
- Revenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts where the Company is standing ready to provide services is recognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight-lined over the period of performance.
- In respect of other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognised using percentage-of-completion method (‘POC method’) of accounting with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of the performance obligation. The contract costs used in computing the revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.
- Revenue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and manufactured systems and third party software is recognised upfront at the point in time when the system / software is delivered to the customer. In cases where implementation and / or customisation services rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services and software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognised over time on a POC method.
- Revenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer.
- The solutions offered by the Company may include supply of third-party equipment or software. In such cases, revenue for supply of such third party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether the Company is acting as the principal or as an agent of the customer. The Company recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration when it is acting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.

Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue also excludes taxes collected from customers.

# Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements

The Company’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. The Company assesses the products / services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables.

Judgement is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation. The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable consideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant financing component. Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for a distinct product or service from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Company allocates the elements of variable considerations to all the performance obligations of the contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct performance obligations.

The Company exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period of time. The Company considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered or who controls the asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of such product or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.

Revenue from subsidiaries is recognised based on transaction price which is at arm’s length.

Contract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for capitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The assessment of this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.

Contract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified as unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms.

Unearned and deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.

The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance based payments and / or milestone based progress payments. Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.

In accordance with Ind AS 37, the Company recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.

Contracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Company reviews modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In the event transaction price is revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.

The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature of services, industry verticals and geography.

# Revenue disaggregation by nature of services is as follows:

Geographical revenue is allocated based on the location of the customers.

# Information about major customers

No single customer represents 10% or more of the Company’s total revenue during the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

While disclosing the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognise those revenues, the Company has applied the practical expedient in Ind AS 115. Accordingly, the Company has not disclosed the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations which pertain to contracts where revenue recognised corresponds to the value transferred to customer typically involving time and material, outcome based and event based contracts.

Unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations are subject to variability due to several factors such as terminations, changes in scope of contracts, periodic revalidations of the estimates, economic factors (changes in currency rates, tax laws etc). The aggregate value of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations is `1,34,160 crore out of which 50.03% is expected to be recognised as revenue in the next year and the balance thereafter. No consideration from contracts with customers is excluded from the amount mentioned above.

# 12) Employee benefits

# Defined benefit plans

For defined benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Past service cost, both vested and unvested, is recognised as an expense at the earlier of (a) when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs; and (b) when the entity recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits.

The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.

The Company provides benefits such as gratuity, pension and provident fund (Company managed fund) to its employees which are treated as defined benefit plans.

# Defined contribution plans

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to such benefits.

The Company provides benefits such as superannuation and foreign defined contribution plans to its employees which are treated as defined contribution plans.

# Short-term employee benefits

All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short-term employee benefits. Benefits such as salaries, wages etc. and the expected cost of ex-gratia are recognised in the period in which the employee renders the related service. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid when there is a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

# Compensated absences

Compensated absences which are expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related services are recognised as undiscounted liability at the balance sheet date. Compensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related services are recognised as an actuarially determined liability at the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date using the Projected Unit Credit Method.

# Employee benefit expenses consist of the following:

# Employee benefit plans consist of the following:

# Gratuity and pension

In accordance with Indian law, the Company operates a scheme of gratuity which is a defined benefit plan. The gratuity plan provides for a lump sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death while in employment or on termination of employment of an amount equivalent to 15 to 30 days’ salary payable for each completed year of service. Vesting occurs upon completion of five continuous years of service. The Company manages the plan through a trust. Trustees administer contributions made to the trust. Certain overseas branches of the Company also provide for retirement benefit plans in accordance with the local laws.

# The following table sets out the details of the defined benefit retirement plans and the amounts recognised in the financial statements:

Future mortality assumptions are taken based on the published statistics by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India.

The expected benefits are based on the same assumptions as are used to measure the Company’s defined benefit plan obligations as at March 31, 2024. The Company does not expect to contribute to defined benefit plan obligations funds for year ending March 31, 2025 in view of adequate surplus plan assets as at March 31, 2024.

The significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligations are discount rate and expected salary increase. The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.

# If the discount rate increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows:

|                   | As at March 31, 2024 | As at March 31, 2023 |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Increase of 0.50% | (123)                | (121)                |
| Decrease of 0.50% | 129                  | 127                  |

# If the expected salary growth increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows:

|                   | As at March 31, 2024 | As at March 31, 2023 |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Increase of 0.50% | 130                  | 129                  |
| Decrease of 0.50% | (125)                | (123)                |

The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligations as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated. Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligations has been calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the balance sheet.

Each year an Asset- Liability matching study is performed in which the consequences of the strategic investment policies are analysed in terms of risk and return profiles. Investment and contribution policies are integrated within this study.

# The defined benefit obligations shall mature after the year ended March 31, 2024 as follows:

| Year ending March 31, | Defined benefit obligations |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 2025                  | 798                         |
| 2026                  | 670                         |
| 2027                  | 665                         |
| 2028                  | 650                         |
| 2029                  | 603                         |
| 2030-2034             | 2,297                       |

# Provident fund

In accordance with Indian law, all eligible employees of the Company in India are entitled to receive benefits under the provident fund plan in which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to a trust set up by the Company to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees. This plan is a defined benefit plan as the Company is obligated to provide its members a rate of return which should, at the minimum, meet the interest rate declared by Government administered provident fund. A part of the Company’s contribution is transferred to Government administered pension fund. The contributions made by the Company and the shortfall of interest, if any, are recognised as an expense in statement of profit and loss under employee benefit expenses. In accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund liabilities on the basis of guidance issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions as mentioned below, there is no deficiency in the interest cost as the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than the expected amount to be credited to the individual members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of Government administered provident fund.

# 15) Income taxes

Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the year. Current and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

# Current income taxes

The current income tax expense includes income taxes payable by the Company having its branches in India and overseas where it operates. The current tax payable by the Company in India is Indian income tax payable on income after taking credit for tax relief available for export operations in Special Economic Zones (SEZs).

Current income tax payable by overseas branches of the Company is computed in accordance with the tax laws applicable in the jurisdiction in which the respective branch operates. The taxes paid are generally available for set off against the Indian income tax liability of the Company’s worldwide income.

Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax paid and income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying unit intends to settle the asset and liability on a net basis.

# Deferred income taxes

Deferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount, except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be received or settled.

For operations carried out in SEZs, deferred tax assets or liabilities, if any, have been established for the tax consequences of those temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases that reverse after the tax holiday ends.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the relevant entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Deferred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, to the extent it would be available for set off against future current income tax liability. Accordingly, MAT is recognised as deferred tax asset in the balance sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will be realised.

# Options Contract

A hedging instrument that offers the buyer the right to buy or sell the underlying asset (such as stocks or currency) on a future date, at a specified price, for small upfront fee called options premium.

Eg: TCS purchases an options contract to sell USD 1 million @ ₹87/US$ after 3 months, paying an option premium of ₹1 million. With this, TCS will have the right to sell USD 1 million at an exchange rate of ₹87, even if the prevailing market rate at the end of three months is, say ₹85. On the other hand, if the market rate is higher, say ₹89, then TCS can choose to let the options contract lapse and instead sell at the market rate.

# Sustainability Disclosures

# TCS Climate Related Disclosures

In FY 2023, TCS’ climate related disclosures were aligned to the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Subsequently, TCFD fulfilled its remit and was disbanded in October 2023.

The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) released IFRS S2, Climate-related Disclosures, in January 2024, which is aligned with the recommendations of TCFD. This year, TCS has disclosed information related to climate-related risk and opportunities aligned with IFRS S2. IFRS S2 applies to disclosure of (1) climate related risks (physical and transitional), to which the entity is exposed and (2) climate related opportunities available to the entity.

The disclosure requirements in IFRS S2 are structured around the core content related to the following sections:

- Section 1: Governance
- Section 2: Strategy
- Section 3: Risk Management
- Section 4: Metrics and Targets

# Section 1: Governance

TCS has a Board level Stakeholder Relationship Committee (SRC) that oversees different aspects of climate-related risks and opportunities.

# Stakeholder Relationship Committee (SRC)

- The SRC is chaired by an independent director and comprises of 3 members including the CEO. It reviews the climate change strategy, approach, and performance of the organization with respect to sustainability and climate change.
- The SRC formally meets twice every year to review policies and sustainability performance, including climate change and carbon performance. The board oversight helps drive the program effectively with greater accountability.
- The CEO, as a part of the SRC, is directly responsible for the efficient operations of the facility and hence is better able to review performance and drive improvement. The updates are provided by the Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) and is supported by the Head- Environmental Sustainability, Health and Safety (ESHS) who oversees the environment and climate change implementation at the organisation.
- TCS’ carbon reduction goal to reduce its absolute greenhouse gas emissions across Scope 1 and Scope 2 by 70% by 2025 (over 2016 base year), and to achieve net zero emissions by 2030, was reviewed and approved by the committee.
- Statement by Senior management: Refer page number 132 in BRSR for N G Subramaniam, COO &#x26; Executive Director’s statement.
- During the half yearly meetings, the SRC monitors the progress towards the carbon targets and the carbon reduction initiatives that have been implemented and planned.

# Competency:

TCS has a competent team working on Environmental Sustainability. TCS’ Head- Environmental Sustainability, Health, and Safety (ESHS) is a Doctorate in Environmental Science and Engineering and has over 30 years of post-doctoral experience in environmental sustainability and climate change. The ESHS team has recruited professionals who have the requisite qualification and experience in climate change and environmental sustainability. The team has undergone training in advanced topics and regularly participates in external training programs and sessions on the emerging frameworks and regulatory requirements around climate change.

TCS is also a member of the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) and National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM), and the company participates as panelist, assessor, or speaker in their training and capacity building workshops on climate change with the perspective of spreading know-how on ESG, climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies among other industries.

Remuneration: Refer page number 103 for information on remuneration of the Board members.

Apart from the SRC, TCS also has the Risk Management Committee (RMC) that is responsible for risk management oversight at the corporate level.

# Risk Management Committee (RMC)

- The RMC is chaired by an independent director and comprises of 5 members including one additional independent director, 2 executive directors, i.e. CEO, COO, and one company executive, CFO.

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24



Sustainability Disclosures

The RMC formulates, monitors, and reviews the company’s risk management policy.

Climate change risks and opportunities are covered under the strategic and operational risks for the Company and are reviewed in the RMC committee meetings.

# Section 2: Strategy

Climate related risks continue to challenge businesses in every possible way, sometimes amplifying existing risks. Not only is their nature evolving, but their speed of impacting the organisation’s operations is also increasing. Operating in an uncertain and ever-changing environment, TCS’ global operations bring in considerable complexities and TCS’ robust enterprise risk management framework aids in ensuring the strategic objectives are achieved. This framework enables risk identification for short, medium, and long term, risk assessment, risk response planning and actions, risk monitoring and overall risk governance.

# Climate-related risks and opportunities

Refer to the MD&#x26;A section on page number 86 of the TCS Integrated Annual Report for identified climate-related risk and opportunities that could reasonably affect TCS’ prospects. The section includes the company’s adaptation methodology which will be implemented over following time horizons:

| Time-horizon | From (years) | To (years) |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| Short-term   | 0            | 5          |
| Medium-term  | 5            | 10         |
| Long-term    | 10           | Beyond 10  |

Below is a brief description of TCS’ approach and identification of climate-related risks and opportunities.

| Climate related R\&O | TCS Approach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Current regulation   | Regulations undergo frequent changes and, to accommodate such changes, the company must be aware and responsive. In India operations, TCS must comply with all the environmental consent conditions around emissions, water discharge, waste recycling etc. These regulations are included in TCS’ risk assessment as compliance risk and thereafter integrated into its mitigation plans. The company also reports to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) mandated BRSR framework, which includes non-financial indicators and is a part of this Integrated Annual report. This year as per BRSR reporting requirements, TCS is also undergoing reasonable assurance for the core indicators of BRSR. |
| Emerging regulation  | Emerging regulations including carbon taxes (coal or fossil fuel taxes leading to escalation in the electricity tariff), mandatory energy audits are examples which are likely to impact the company. Regulations around procurement of renewable energy, which is a key driver of the company’s climate change mitigation plan, is also ever evolving in all major geographies. TCS keeps a close watch on the emerging regulations and plans its organizational sustainability strategy and roadmap to adapt to those changes.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Technology           | With more energy efficient and eco-friendly building and IT equipment coming in the market, keeping TCS’ offices eco-efficient is an ongoing process wherein the company evaluates the technology and suitability and work on a phaseout plan to move to the new more efficient technology. These are considered as operational risks and opportunities which drive the company to make its infrastructure more climate resilient.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Legal                | TCS tracks environmental legal compliance (air emissions, water discharges, waste management and others) on periodic basis and have a very robust internal compliance management system to identify and comply with all legal requirements of current, amended and new regulations. While the possibility of a litigation risk is very low, climate change impacts can pose few risks indirectly to TCS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Market               | Climate change is driving a lot of changes in the company’s customer behaviour, thus creating new markets and new opportunities, giving TCS an opportunity to partner with them in their climate change mitigation journey by providing solutions, services, and process automation which helps in emission reduction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Reputation           | Reputational risk is relevant to the company as the investor and customer community is becoming increasingly aware of climate change related issues. It is important to demonstrate leadership in climate action to maintain reputation. Climate risks are hence included as strategic risks which is reviewed by leadership to position the company better in the market. This information is required to respond to CDP supply chain module and various customer surveys on sustainability like Dow Jones Sustainability Index, EcoVadis, MSCI, Sustainalytics, etc. Hence performing well in these ratings/scorings is very crucial in maintaining the market reputation which the organization holds.            |
| Acute physical       | Acute physical risks associated with extreme weather events is relevant as TCS has substantial operations in coastal cities in India which are exposed to extreme weather events like heavy precipitation, flood, and cyclones. E.g., The company’s offices located in coastal cities like Chennai, Bhubaneshwar, Kolkata, Kochi are exposed to physical risks from cyclonic events and therefore adequate mitigation plans are in place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

# Sustainability Disclosures

# Climate related TCS Approach

Despite the Paris Agreement and global climate action, global warming continues unabated. Having presence in many major cities across the world, TCS is subject to climate change related chronic physical impacts like change in precipitation pattern, with resultant effects like drought or flood. Also, with TCS’s presence in few coastal cities, rise in sea level and related impacts like land submergence, saltwater intrusion, disruption to network and communication systems are more likely. These risks are long term and included from perspective of planning appropriate infrastructure. TCS has set targets to reduce carbon emissions (scope 1 and 2) by 70% in 2025 compared to 2016 base year and achieve Net Zero by 2030. These are aligned with the global goals taken under the Paris agreement to fight global warming by keeping the planet’s temperature below 1.5 degrees Celsius. TCS has reduced its absolute carbon footprint across Scope 1 and Scope 2 by 80% in FY 2024 over a baseline of 2016, exceeding TCS’ target achievement by 10%, one year ahead of time.

# Business model and value chain

TCS’ business model and value chain includes its customers and suppliers. The sustainability and climate related transition risks are covered here along with some mitigation plans.

# Customers

TCS is an IT services and business solution provider company working mostly with Fortune 1000 or Global 2000 corporations and the public sector. The customer perception around climate change risks has strengthened, especially in the major markets, and this is reflected in the increasing customer requests on climate change performance through platforms like CDP, SBTi commitment, RFPs. These all show how adapting to changing customer behaviour around climate change is crucial for business continuity.

TCS’ stakeholders, especially its customers and employees look at it as a responsible corporate citizen when it comes to climate action. The company’s efforts in this domain have been recognized through ESG ratings and CDP ratings / climate change performance (carbon reduction against targets, % renewable energy). In an event, if TCS is unable to meet its climate change commitments, it can lead to a negative impact on its brand and reputation, as well as ESG ratings. A failure to meet the targets, customer expectations or evolving regulatory requirements could also potentially affect its market capitalization. TCS ensures that these risks are identified at an early stage and work on mitigation and improvement plans.

The company also has a robust business continuity plan. It is an end-to-end framework that effectively manages through defined policy, procedures, guidelines and through in-house developed tools that support planning and communication with all stakeholders. The framework is fully compliant and certified to ISO 22301:2019, CMMI-SVC and is integrated with TCS quality management system for consistent deployment across the organization. TCS also has Emergency Preparedness Plans (EPP) for disasters such as earthquake, floods, cyclones etc in its internal portal. The plan outlays the responsibilities of action owners, plan description including precautions to be taken, evacuation procedures and post incident action plan which would need to be followed at locations facing the emergency scenario.

# Suppliers

Towards ongoing sustainability assessment, TCS launched its Supplier Sustainability Assessment Platform in FY 2023 and initiated on-boarding of its top supply chain partners. Through this platform, TCS plans to support its suppliers with engagement and guidance to help them improve their sustainability performance. In FY 2024, the company has successfully assessed 17% of its value chain partners (by spend) for sustainability criteria. These efforts ensure that all suppliers who form upstream part of the value chain are assessed for sustainability and climate risks.

# Strategy and decision-making

Climate-related risks and opportunities have influenced TCS’ strategy in the following ways:

| Supply chain and/or value chain                        | Supply Chain sustainability through responsible sourcing is one of the risk mitigations that TCS has identified under its sustainability risk. TCS’s Green Procurement policy outlines its commitment to making its supply chain more responsible and sustainable. Energy efficiency is one of the major procurement considerations in all the company’s IT assets procurement as this is directly correlated with its emission profile. Climate related risks play a very important role in supply chain engagements, and TCS is working with its suppliers to bring in improvements in overall supply chain sustainability related aspects. As mentioned in the previous section on suppliers, TCS has launched the supplier sustainability assessment platform to facilitate improvements in the supply chain through evaluation and assessment of suppliers. |
| Investment in R\&I                                     | TCS’ investments in R\&I have resulted in solutions like Envirozone™, Clever Energy and IP2™. TCS has been using Clever Energy for the last several years to monitor and help reduce its energy consumption and is now commercially selling it and the other two solutions to clients to help them achieve their sustainability goals. Additionally, TCS has been investing in building green campuses (IGBC certified). These initiatives have enabled reduction of carbon footprint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Operations                                             | Climate Change risks play an important consideration in TCS’ operations. TCS has created an environmentally sustainable approach by creating green policies, processes, frameworks, and infrastructure. The company’s campuses are designed to withstand extreme weather events and the business continuity plans are tested periodically to ensure continued operations without any disruption. Green buildings, efficient operations, green IT, the use of renewable energy to reduce carbon footprint; adoption of newer technologies and methods to manage waste in line with circular economy principles are integral to business operations. These all help the company in achieving its emission reduction targets and journey towards Net Zero by 2030.                                                                                                  |
| Direct costs, Capital expenditures, Capital allocation | Climate risks and opportunities are one of the factors while making financial considerations especially while making investments in offices, equipment, and renewable energy production. Investment in these areas constitutes a substantial share of the company’s overall capital investment. Major investments are in green buildings, roof top solar and other energy efficiency initiatives. Refer BRSR section, Principle 6, page number 152, 153 for more details on the initiatives that also help the company to position itself as leaders in the climate domain hence contribute substantially to its market value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

# Financial position, financial performance, and cash flows

# Substantive financial or strategic impact of Risk Assessment:

Climate risks like business disruption, changing regulatory landscape, acute physical stress and transition risks are identified, prioritized, assessed and managed by the ERM team. Anything with the potential to disrupt regular operations by more than 10% and triggers Business Continuity Plans at the sites is considered as substantial. The financial risk exposure is calculated considering the following quantifiable indicators- (1) Proportion of business units affected OR percentage of operations impacted; (2) Probability of occurrence of extreme climate related events, and 3) the impact potential at the affected locations based on size of operation. In any given year the overall potential financial impact due to an extreme weather event is considered as 0.75% of the revenue. TCS considers a risk tolerance of 10% of the exposure for climate related risks and considered as substantive. Based on the severity and the risk exposure, the appropriate risk response is finalized, and mitigation actions are assigned to relevant functions.

The company has identified the following climate-related risks with the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on the company’s business:

1. Risk of impact on direct operations: TCS has large operations based out of offices in coastal cities which have a high exposure to extreme weather events like high rainfall, cyclones, rise in sea level, etc. During FY 2024, there were no major cyclones that affected the company’s campuses. However, earlier event like Cyclone Amphan led to damages in its Kolkata, India campus specifically to the rooftop solar PV installations, solar water heater panels, roof mounted HVAC components, HRW electrical panel room, energy bin of biogas chamber, apart from multiple water leakages at basement and many other external physical damages. This indicates the increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events such as cyclones and floods and the impact these can cause directly on the operations. TCS accounts for such risks at design stage through cyclone and flood water resistance considerations while constructing new buildings. For greenfield projects, the building structure is designed (a) for seismic load as per IS 1893 (Part-1) 2016; Amendment No:2-2020 and (b) for wind speeds as per IS 875 codes.

TCS has a strong business continuity plan (critical business operations can be shifted to another city/country/geography) and therefore these physical risks will not affect the business operations significantly, except for the financial implications related to infrastructure damages (if any). Hence the potential financial impact due to physical damage because of extreme weather events is calculated as a percentage of revenue using a risk factor, which in turn is arrived through the company’s risk assessment exercises. The potential financial impact will be 0.75% of the revenue which comes to approximately ₹ 1,807 crores or US$218 million.
2. Risk of increase in capital expenditure: TCS is an IT services, consulting, and business solutions organization with a presence across multiple geographies, industries, services and products. Being one of the frontrunners in ESG performance, in 2021, the company has taken up ambitious carbon targets as mentioned in previous sections and have also achieved its near-term targets 2 years ahead.

of timelines. In FY 2024, TCS has further brought down its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission by 80% over base year 2016. This was despite increased electricity consumption in FY 2024 from employees’ return to office and addition of new offices to the reporting boundary. Apart from organizational level commitments, the emerging regulations also motivate TCS to transition towards low carbon business. TCS will need additional CAPEX and OPEX to ensure compliance. The company has envisaged this as a risk, and is developing greener solutions and transitioning to renewable energy. In FY 2024, RE accounts for 74% of total energy and have increased percentage of green tariff.

1. TCS’ new campuses are designed according to green building standards for energy and resource efficiency to reduce the carbon footprint. The company invests in energy efficiency initiatives taking into consideration a payback period of 4-5 years. It is also retrofitting its older buildings with energy efficient equipment.
2. TCS’ IoT-based Real-time Energy Management System (TCS Clever Energy™) initiative that involves real time monitoring to optimize the operational energy efficiency is used across all offices. This smart, scalable, analytics driven IoT solution uses TCS Connected Universe Platform (TCUP) IoT platform, which forms the backbone enabling visualization of data acquired from various locations and facilities’ energy meters and sensors.
3. While the above initiatives were carried out across TCS India campuses, focus towards achieving Net Zero is also driven through carbon neutrality across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in North America, UK and Ireland, Europe, Asia Pacific, Japan, Latin America, and Middle East &#x26; Africa.

# c. Risk of Impacting Reputation and Brand Value

TCS is an IT services company working mostly with Fortune 1000 or Global 2000 corporations and the public sector. The customer perception around climate change risks has strengthened, especially in the major markets, and this is reflected in the increasing customer requests on climate change performance through platforms like CDP, SBTi commitments, RFPs and other surveys/ questionnaires. Thus, in an event if TCS is unable to meet its climate change commitments, it can impact the company’s brand and reputation, as well as international ESG ratings. The risk due to the same is realized in terms of the company’s brand value and the risk is estimated as 0.1% of the same. In FY 2024, TCS brand value rose to US$19.2 billion (Source: Brand Finance). Hence, the potential financial impact due to this risk is estimated at US$19.2 million. To mitigate these impacts, the company has undertaken many initiatives to mitigate its environmental impact which includes green building design, energy efficient building and IT infrastructure, and transition to renewable energy. All the stakeholders are well informed about TCS’ climate change performance through its external disclosures which helps to minimize the reputational risks.

TCS has identified the following climate-related opportunities with the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on its business:

1. TCS has a large building footprint with its campuses alone covering more than 38 million sq. ft area in India. Out of this, over 67.3% of its buildings are certified to IGBC Green Building standards. TCS has steadily increased its portfolio of green buildings, thereby ensuring energy efficiency in its buildings and reducing both emissions and operating expenditures. Apart from this, the company is also working on improving and upgrading its energy efficiency in existing buildings. Few years back, TCS India took up a major project to change the luminaires to LEDs across its locations which contributed towards significant energy savings. Major retrofits were carried out at some locations with legacy infrastructure to improve the efficiency levels. The TCS Remote Energy Management and Control program witnessed rapid scaling up and further maturity during the year by leveraging IoT platform to acquire asset (chillers, air handling units, etc.) level data which is analyzed to improve asset efficiency and operations. The data center PUE (weighted average) of 1.70 was achieved for the corporate data centers at Mumbai and Chennai. In FY 2024, TCS has achieved a saving to the tune of 16,301 MWh due to energy saving initiatives. (This includes HVAC energy efficiency projects, UPS based energy efficiency projects, expansion in green buildings and real time monitoring of energy efficiency). TCS uses multiple energy sources in its daily operations, electricity being the primary source. Majority of the electricity comes from conventional sources, but TCS has increased the share of renewable electricity (RE) over the years through onsite rooftop solar generation, third party procurement and purchase of Energy Attribute Certificate (EAC) (in select geographies). The RE consumption as a percentage of total electricity consumption has increased from 15.6% in FY 2021 to 74% in FY 2024. TCS’ owned roof top solar projects contribute 3 % of the same. Apart from roof top solar photo voltaic installations, TCS increased the renewable energy procurement through a switch over to green tariffs for operations and open access power purchase agreements (PPA).
2. TCS is looking at developing solutions that respond to changing consumer behaviour. Through its Connected Marketing team, TCS uses sustainability in the social media perspective to better understand the ‘green’ needs of its consumers, and to also see how consumers are reacting to the new green products that have been introduced. Changing consumer behaviour and expectations are most reflective in the power utility space. Towards this area, TCS has developed several strategic partnerships, towards thought-leadership development and solution enhancement (Example: Smart Power and Smart Energy are key solution areas of TCS’ Utilities Industry Unit).

# Climate Resilience

A brief description of the resilience of the organization’s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2oC or lower scenario.

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24




# Sustainability Disclosures

# Climate related Parameters, assumptions, analytical choices scenario

# Transition scenarios IEA B2DS

The climate change scenario analysis conducted for TCS takes a multi-level approach to identify climate risk and opportunity hot spots, interdependencies, and interaction with global macro trends. The top-down analysis of the macro environmental trends that will impact the company at global level included:

- a) nature loss and ecological degradation,
- b) resource scarcity and driving value chain innovation,
- c) changing customer and workforce preferences,
- d) the rise of extreme weather,
- e) increasing regulations, pricing and disclosure of externalities,
- f) digitalization and prevalence of infectious diseases and
- g) rising incomes.

Detailed analysis was conducted of material climate change transition risks and opportunities across value chain and assessment of interdependencies between climate risks and opportunities including identification of areas of potential magnification and hedge opportunities. The key value driver analysis assesses climate risks and opportunities across 3 stages of the value chain including:

- a) Supply Chain (input supplies costs, disruption and access to supplies)
- b) Operations (carbon costs, operating costs, insurance/ damage costs due to disruption of operation)
- c) End Markets (demand for low carbon services/ products, market share and competition).

In the transition scenario, the IEA B2DS approach has been selected as its more conservative scenario. The inputs included those from Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) reports, the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Government of India plan on energy efficiency and solar energy. The assumptions used in the analysis also considered the anticipated growth of TCS over the years and increased energy demand. Changing customer behaviour and carbon costs are assessed as a transition risk to TCS with a growing number of jurisdictions at regional and national level planning to implement a carbon tax or emission trading scheme.

# Physical climate scenarios RCP 8.5

The climate change scenario analysis conducted for TCS takes a multi-level approach to identify climate risk and opportunity hot spots, interdependencies, and interaction with global macro trends. The top-down analysis of the macro environmental trends that will impact the company at global level included:

- a) nature loss and ecological degradation,
- b) resource scarcity and driving value chain innovation,
- c) changing customer and workforce preferences,
- d) the rise of extreme weather,
- e) increasing regulations, pricing, and disclosure of externalities,
- f) digitalization and prevalence of infectious diseases and
- g) rising incomes.

Detailed analysis was conducted of material climate change physical risks and opportunities across value chain and assessment of interdependencies between climate risks and opportunities including identification of areas of potential magnification and hedge opportunities. The key value drivers’ analysis assesses them across 3 stages of the value chain including:

- a) Supply Chain (input supplies costs, disruption and access to supplies)
- b) Operations (carbon costs, operating costs, insurance/ damage costs due to disruption of operation)
- c) End Markets (demand for low carbon services/ products, market share and competition).

The physical risk is assessed using the RCP 8.5 scenario. The RCP 8.5 scenario takes a global warming between 3-4 degrees above pre-industrial levels which is a conservative scenario and helps TCS understand the worst-case climate impacts on its operations. The inputs included IPCC reports, the NDCs, the SDGs and Govt. of India plan on energy efficiency and solar energy. The assumptions used in the analysis also considered the anticipated growth of TCS over the years and increased energy demand. Few strategies to mitigate physical risks of climate change include:

1. A robust Business Continuity Plan (BCP) to respond to climate events
2. Investments in climate resilient infrastructure (for cyclone, floods).

# Section 3: Risk management

At TCS, the Corporate Risk Office, led by the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for driving Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) across all functions in line with TCS Global Risk Management Policy. Refer the MD&#x26;A section on page numbers 78, for details on how ERM is driven across the company on all topics, including climate related risks and opportunities. The company also considers evolving concepts, trends, policies, customer requirements, regulations, and climate scenario analysis to identify Risk &#x26; Opportunities. The company also considers international guidelines/frameworks like GRI, SASB, and CDP for Risk &#x26; Opportunity drivers.

Risk Assessment Methodology: Refer the MD&#x26;A section page number 79 of the TCS Integrated Annual Report for information on Enterprise Risk Management process followed at TCS.

# Sustainability Disclosures

All climate-related risks are embedded into entity’s overall risk management process. TCS has an internal application where identified risks are baselined at the beginning of the year, tracked quarterly and updated with relevant progress. Each risk has an expiry date. Each risk owner responds with the progress and at the end of the financial year ensures closing of the risk.

# Section 4: Metrics and targets

# Climate related metrics

1. Climate-related metrics – Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in metric tons of CO2 equivalent are disclosed on page number 152, 158 of the BRSR report. The emissions are in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standards. TCS has a robust environmental sustainability tool where all relevant environmental data are collected monthly, validated, and internally assured periodically across geographies. All locations within the operational control of TCS are included in the boundary of environmental data reporting (consolidated accounting group as per IFRS-S2). GHG emission factors are used from the latest version of IEA, DEFRA, USEPA, GHG Protocol All Sector Tools and regional sources for specific geographies (e.g. CEA for India) to estimate the GHG emissions. The approach, inputs and assumptions are detailed on Page number 152, 158 as part of the BRSR section. The carbon emission data is independently assured by external assurance providers at the end of the financial year. In FY 2024, scope 1 and 2 emissions have undergone reasonable assurance and scope 3 has been subject to limited assurance by KPMG. TCS reports its scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions in the Integrated Annual Report and in CDP (Climate change) disclosures.
2. Climate-related transition risks—Business activities vulnerable to climate-related transition risks;- Refer section Sustainability Risks- Climate change and Environmental aspects (R &#x26; O), page number 86.
3. Climate-related physical risks—Business activities vulnerable to climate-related physical risks;- Refer section Sustainability Risks- Climate change and Environmental aspects (R &#x26; O), page number 86.
4. Climate-related opportunities—Business activities aligned with climate-related opportunities;- Refer section Sustainability Risks- Climate change and Environmental aspects (R &#x26; O), page number 86.
5. Capital deployment—the amount of capital expenditure, financing or investment deployed towards climate-related risks and opportunities;- Refer BRSR section in Principle 2 (Percentage of R&#x26;D and capital expenditure (capex) investments in specific technologies to improve the environmental and social impacts of product and processes to total R&#x26;D and capex investments made by the entity, respectively, Page number 135)
6. Internal carbon prices: The organization has calculated an internal carbon price based on the total investments envisaged for energy efficiency programs, transition to renewable energy and other investments towards emission reductions. Currently TCS does not apply this carbon price to determine the feasibility of projects or to apply a carbon tax to generate funding for the projects. All these projects and initiatives are driven through internal accruals since they align to overall company and Tata Group philosophy. Currently, TCS is not focusing on offsetting to drive reductions and the company may take up the carbon cost/tax mechanism in the future to generate budgets for purchase of offset instruments. In the coming years, the company may plan to consider applying a carbon tax to business travel (and employee commuting-company provided transport) to bring out the “carbon” cost. This will help reduce Category 6 and 7 of Scope 3 emissions by either reducing travel or switching to carbon efficient means of travel and transportation (like EVs). The price for each metric tonne of greenhouse gas emissions the entity uses to assess the costs of its greenhouse gas emissions is ₹ 2,365.

Business decision-making processes this internal carbon price is applied to are:

- Capital expenditure
- Operations procurement
- Risk management
- Opportunity management
- Value chain engagement

# Remuneration

Refer page number 103 for information on remuneration of the Board members.

# Climate-related targets

TCS’ climate related targets are mentioned along with its metrics, timeline, and performance in page 24, 25 of the Natural Capital section. In May 2021, TCS set carbon target of 70% reduction of absolute Scope 1 + 2 emissions by 2025 (vs base year 2016) and Net Zero by 2030. This target setting is aimed to mitigate the carbon emissions from its activities and enables adapting to climate change risks. The target applies to the entity in entirety across geographies. TCS has already achieved 71% reduction in scope 1 and 2 emissions in FY 2023 (Vs 2016) and 80% reduction in FY 2024 (Vs 2016) thereby overachieving the targets much ahead of its timelines. The performance against the targets is disclosed in this Integrated Annual Report in the Natural Capital Section on Page numbers 24 and 25.

TCS has made its commitment to SBTi targets. In June 2022, TCS has responded to SBTi’s urgent call for corporate climate action by committing to align with 1.5°C and net-zero through the Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign. This is published on SBTi website and can be viewed at Companies taking action- Science Based Targets. TCS is working towards submitting the targets for validation by SBTi.

# Independent Practitioners’ Limited Assurance Report

To the Directors of Tata Consultancy Services Limited

Assurance report on select sustainability disclosures in the Integrated Annual Report prepared in accordance with the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting (BRSR) framework and with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards 2021 (together called ‘Identified Sustainability Information’ (ISI)) of Tata Consultancy Services Limited (TCS) (the ‘Company’) for the period from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024.

# Opinion

We have performed an assurance engagement on the Identified Sustainability Information (ISI) as detailed in the table below:

| Identified Sustainability Information (ISI) subject to assurance                    | Period                             | Page number in the Annual Report | Reporting criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Select GRI and BRSR attributes (which are not part of BRSR Core) (refer Annexure 1) | From 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024 | 127 to 166 and 315 to 327        | GRI Standards 2021 Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements (SEBI LODR) World Resource Institute (WRI) / World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol (A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standards) Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting & Reporting Standard Guidance note for BRSR format issued by SEBI |

This engagement was conducted by a multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners, engineers and environmental and social professionals.

Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention to cause us to believe that the company’s Identified Sustainability Information on pages [127] to [166] and [315] to [327] of the Annual Report relating to select GRI and BRSR attributes (which are not part of BRSR Core) for the year ended 31 March 2024, subject to limited assurance is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the World Resource Institute (WRI)/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol (A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standards).

Sustainability Disclosures

Reporting Standards), and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting &#x26; Reporting Standard, Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements (SEBI LODR) and with reference to the GRI Standards (2021) and basis of preparation set out in page 128 Section A: General Disclosures 13 of the Integrated Annual Report.

We do not express an assurance opinion on information in respect of any other information included in the Integrated Annual Report 2024 or linked from the Sustainability Information or from the Integrated Annual Report 2023, including any images, audio files or embedded videos.

# Basis for opinion and conclusion

We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, and ISAE 3410, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Our responsibilities” section of our report.

We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA).

Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements, issued by the IAASB. This standard requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management, including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.

# Other information

Additionally, we have performed a reasonable assurance engagement on SEBI BRSR Core attributes and issued an independent assurance report on 08 May 2024. Our report thereon is included with the other information.

Our limited assurance opinion on the ISI does not extend to other information that accompanies or contains the ‘ISI and our assurance report’ (hereafter referred to as “other information”). We have read the other information, but we have not performed any procedures with respect to the other information.

# Other matter

Select BRSR and GRI attributes of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2023 were assured by the previous assurance practitioner who had expressed an unmodified opinion on 09 June 2023. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24


# Sustainability Disclosures

Intended use or purpose

The ISI and our limited assurance report are intended for users who have reasonable knowledge of the BRSR attributes and GRI attributes, the reporting criteria and ISI and who have read the information in the ISI with reasonable diligence and understand that the ISI is prepared and assured at appropriate levels of materiality. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Responsibilities for Identified Sustainability Information (ISI)

The management of the company are responsible for:

- designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;
- selecting or developing suitable criteria for preparing the Identified Sustainability Information and appropriately referring to or describing the criteria; and
- preparing the Identified Sustainability Information in accordance with the reporting criteria.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the reporting process for the company’s ISI.

Exclusions:

Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we will not express a conclusion on the same:

- Operations of the Company other than those mentioned in the “Scope of Assurance”.
- Aspects of the BRSR and GRI attributes and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the ISI.
- Data and information outside the defined reporting period i.e., 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024.
- The statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim, or future intentions provided by the Company.

Inherent limitations

The preparation of the company’s sustainability information requires the management to establish or interpret the criteria, make determinations about the relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported information. Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR and GRI attributes, some of which are estimates, is subject to substantial inherent measurement uncertainty, for example GHG emissions, water footprint, energy footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to support our opinion/conclusion does not reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics.

# Our responsibilities

We are responsible for:

- planning and performing the engagement to obtain a limited assurance about whether the ISI is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;
- forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained; and
- reporting our conclusion to the Directors of TCS.

# Summary of the work we performed as the basis for our conclusion

We exercised professional judgement and maintained professional skepticism throughout the engagement. We designed and performed our procedures to obtain evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for limited assurance conclusion.

# Limited assurance conclusion

Our procedures selected depended on our understanding of the information subject to limited assurance and other engagement circumstances, and our consideration of areas where material misstatements are likely to arise. In carrying out our engagement, we:

- assessed the suitability of the criteria used by the company in preparing the information subject to limited assurance;
- interviewed senior management and relevant staff at corporate and selected locations concerning policies for occupational health and safety, and the implementation of these across the business;
- through inquiries, obtained an understanding of TCS’s control environment, processes and information systems relevant to the preparation of the information subject to limited assurance, but did not evaluate the design of particular control activities, obtain evidence about their implementation or test their operating effectiveness;
- made inquiries of relevant staff at corporate and selected locations responsible for the preparation of the information subject to limited assurance;
- undertook ten site visits out of which seven were physical site visits and three were virtual site visits; we selected these sites based on the relative size of the workforce of these locations to the total workforce, unexpected fluctuations in the information subject to limited assurance since the prior period, and sites not visited in the prior period;
- inspected, at each site visited, a limited number of items to or from supporting records, as appropriate;
- applied analytical procedures, as appropriate;
- recalculated the information subject to limited assurance based on the criteria;

Integrated Annual Report 2023-24

# Sustainability Disclosures

• evaluated the overall presentation of the information subject to limited assurance to determine whether it is consistent with the criteria and in line with our overall knowledge of, and experience with, the company’s occupational health and safety.

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.
