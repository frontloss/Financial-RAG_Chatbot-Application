Letter from the Chairman

# Letter from the Chairman

The global environment is going through considerable changes. At the same time, the world is navigating several important transitions: the Energy transition, the Supply Chain transition and the AI transition. Undoubtedly, these transitions will require significant investments in technology and innovation, and offer a huge growth opportunity for the IT industry.

# Letter from the Chairman | 6




# Letter from the Chairman

Dear Shareholder,

I am pleased to share that your company has done well in a volatile global environment in the year gone by. In FY 2023, your company delivered revenue of ₹225,458 crore, a growth of 17.6%. This growth has come at an industry-leading operating margin of 24.1%.

TCS continues to play a crucial role with clients to enable their business transformation, helping them accelerate new technology adoption and bring agility into execution. We work with large enterprises on transformation initiatives to build a digital foundation for the future, enable strategic leverage of data and artificial intelligence (AI) and reimagine customer and employee experiences.

Your company delivered healthy client metrics enabled by new customer additions and deep client relationships. In FY 2023, growth has come from broad-based performance across markets and industry verticals. The order book continues to be strong, indicating demand for your company’s services. From a talent perspective, the employee strength grew to over 614,000 associates with 35.7% women associates.

The global environment is going through considerable changes. Geopolitical factors such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, rising inflation and volatile commodity prices have caused slowing down of global growth and created stress in the overall economic environment.

Your company is significantly investing in building AI capabilities which include products and platforms that are AI-powered. Over the last few years, your company has leveraged partnerships to design and orchestrate a completely indigenous software-defined 4G/5G network stack. 5G technologies along with IoT, edge and AI will enable new digital transformation opportunities across industries, both industrial and consumer. We will also invest in research areas important for the future, in collaboration with our global academic partners and start-up ecosystem.

At the same time, the world is navigating several transitions. Undoubtedly, these transitions will require significant investments in technology and innovation, and offer a huge growth opportunity for the IT industry. The global energy transition is accelerating. Businesses are making clear commitments towards a sustainable future. There are many innovations across products, services, manufacturing, and delivery. New business models are also emerging. This requires investments in technology and innovation including electric mobility, renewable power, hydrogen and sustainable fuel. In addition, sustainability compliance and reporting requirements are fast evolving as new standards and regulations are coming into play. Across the facets of this transition, investments in IT and digital technology will be an important enabler for businesses.

The supply chain transition resulting from the geo-political situation is altering the global supply chains. Companies are rebalancing their supply chains for resilience and efficiency. New global supply chain ecosystems are being created with India playing an important role. This is being led by significant capital investments in technology to set-up ‘digital-first’ manufacturing and supply chain operations as well as to build ecosystem integration with partners.

In the past decade, there has been a rapid evolution of digital technologies, bringing about a transformation across every industry. Now, the advancements in AI have made AI transition a central focus. The impact of AI and Machine learning is going to be profound. There is a transition already underway from predictive AI to generative AI. Majority of the businesses are still adopting predictive AI and are on the journey of capturing large volume of data, harnessing the power of cloud and IoT. There are varying levels of adoption in companies across sectors. Leveraging generative AI would further require technology innovation and investments.

I would like to thank Rajesh Gopinathan for his contribution during his tenure as CEO &#x26; MD and I wish him the very best for the future. I also take this opportunity to wish K Krithivasan the very best in his new role as CEO &#x26; MD of your company.

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Tata Consultancy Services, I want to thank you for your continued trust, confidence, and support.

Warm regards,

N Chandrasekaran
Chairman




Our full services capability enables us to help our clients thrive, in good times and bad. During the up-cycle, we help clients accelerate and expand their technology-led innovation to differentiate themselves and drive growth. On the down cycle, we help them adapt, using technology to drive the efficiency, agility and resilience needed to cope with a faltering economy, and prepare for better times ahead.

# Letter to Shareholders1

Dear Stakeholder,

Demand for our services showed remarkable resilience even as other parts of the technology universe deflated, and macroeconomic uncertainties worsened in our major markets throughout FY 2023. Our revenue for the year was ₹225,458 crore, a growth of 17.6% over the prior year (13.7% in constant currency).

This growth came with an industry leading operating margin of 24.1%. Our Net Margin was at 18.7%. The Earnings Per Share was at ₹115.19, a growth of 11.2% over the prior year.

From an industry vertical perspective, growth in FY 2023 was led by Retail and Consumer Business, which grew 22.1%, Life Sciences and Healthcare which grew 20.2% and Communications, Media and Technology which grew 18.1%. Banking, Financial Services and Insurance grew 14.6% while Manufacturing grew 14.1%. Others, which make up 8.2% of revenues, grew 22.5%.

By geographic markets, North America grew 24.2%, UK grew 11.4% and Continental Europe grew 9.2%. Among emerging markets, Latin America grew 24.8%, India grew 14.9%, Middle East &#x26; Africa grew 12.5% while Asia Pacific grew 7.1%.

The Board has recommended a final dividend of ₹24 per share, bringing the total dividend for the year to ₹115 per share. For the full year, the company’s shareholder payout was ₹42,079 crore, 108.2% of the free cash flow during the year.

Cloud transformation remained a high priority area for enterprises in FY 2023, with greater focus on execution. They engaged us to take up the modernization and migration of their bigger, more complex workloads. The breadth and depth of our cloud expertise, our scale, deep domain knowledge, strong partnership credentials with the hyperscalers and our portfolio of intellectual property on the cloud, give us a distinct competitive edge in this phase of the cloud adoption cycle.

We also helped clients cope with the challenge of managing cloud expenses. In some cases, it required rearchitecting their application stack to be more cloud native, capable of dynamically ramping up resource consumption during periods of high demand, and automatic ramping down at other times. Elsewhere, we offered our FinOps advisory and cloud managed services to rein in cloud costs.

The adoption of cloud technologies continues to drive innovation within enterprises. The availability of compute, data

and networks at scale provides access to powerful technologies like advanced analytics and machine learning, applied to diverse areas like computer vision, text and speech processing, in domains like dynamic supply chain optimization, new molecule discovery in life sciences and usage-based pricing of insurance coverage.

Newer developments like generative AI, large language models, and quantum computing triggered more experimentation and innovation by our clients. Our investments in research and innovation across different industries, and our Pace innovation architecture have positioned us well to partner with them in these initiatives. Our Agile Innovation Cloud offering, where we create dedicated, location-independent innovation teams to help clients accelerate and scale up their innovation, gained further traction in FY 2023. 7 new clients signed up during the year, bringing the total to 30 clients.

Some of the emerging innovation themes that we helped customers with include ecosystem and multi-industry models underpinned by technologies like data marketplaces, API and blockchain, in industries like transportation and public sector; AI-powered autonomous robotics in the logistics industry, and new applications for digital twins in the BFSI, Telecom and Retail industries. As macroeconomic uncertainty increased in the second half of the year, we saw clients adapting by reprioritizing their spends and showing greater interest in such operating model transformations.

Within our growth and transformation (G&#x26;T) portfolio, business model innovation continued to be a key theme. For example, for a large Fortune 500 electric gas utility, we built the service delivery platform central to their new business model of providing warranty repair, refurbishment and replacement and play transformation of a range of business and technology functions, horizontal and vertical. Nearly 300 of our clients have used it to transform their business and IT operations.

Ingram Micro, one of the largest technology distributors in the US, engaged us as a partner to power their pivot into e-commerce and achieve their mission to transform from a traditional distributor to a platform company that does distribution. Tapestry Inc, a leading New York-based house of iconic accessories and lifestyle brands such as Coach, Kate Spade, &#x26; Stuart Weitzman, partnered with TCS to drive their omnichannel modernization and transform the customer journey experience.

Other G&#x26;T themes, such as M&#x26;A and sustainability continued to bring in high-profile deal wins and new strategic engagements for us in FY 2023. Elsewhere in this report, you can read about the work we did for Philips Domestic Appliances in its journey to be a standalone company, and how we helped Eversource Energy pursue its carbon neutrality aspirations.

Digital transformation, which began in the front office, towards enhancing customer experience, made further inroads within the enterprise during the year, unlocking tremendous value in the middle and back office. As critical technologies such as machine vision and conversational systems get better with the use of AI, our Machine First™ approach is helping clients use them innovatively in the back office, embedding them into reimagined processes to drive greater velocity, agility, throughput and resilience – which, among other things, also enhances customer experience.

# So long, farewell

This year marks a key milestone in my journey with TCS, and an important transition point for the company, as I step down from my role as CEO and MD on 31st May 2023. It has been an absolute privilege and an unparalleled learning experience to lead our company in the last six years, a period of tremendous growth and transformation for us.

# Current Workforce Overview

In FY 2023, we focused on utilizing the spare capacity built up in the prior year, and recalibrated our hiring especially as attrition started falling in the second half of the year. Our LTM attrition in IT services for the year was 20.1%. Net addition in FY 2023 was 22,600, and the closing headcount was 614,795. Our workforce continued to be very diverse, with over 150 nationalities represented and with women making up 35.7% of the employee base.

# Investments in Talent Development

Our investments in organic talent development continue to deliver exceptional outcomes. In FY 2023, TCSers logged 48.3 million learning hours, and acquired nearly 6 million competencies. Popular technologies witnessed unprecedented levels of interest from our employees. During the year, 53,000 TCSers acquired certification on hyperscaler cloud skills, bringing the total number to over 110,000, making TCS one of the Top 2 partners to the largest cloud providers.

# Community Engagement

Caring for Communities

We continued to work with communities across the world, pursuing our long-standing commitment to programs in the areas of skills development, bridging of digital divides and STEM education. In FY 2023, we estimate that our community initiatives touched the lives of over 4.5 million beneficiaries – women, youth and members of marginalized communities.

Our large programs in India around literacy, digital entrepreneurship and youth skilling continued to gain scale. Likewise, our STEM initiatives outside India. goIT is shaping the next generation of digital innovators in 42 countries, while Ignite my Future in School program has doubled its original goal, serving over 2 million students and educators in five geographies worldwide since inception in 2017.

I have had the pleasure of interacting with some of you in person over the last decade. Your feedback and insights helped me learn and shaped my worldview. Thank you for all your support and encouragement.

# Looking Ahead

With enterprises relying on technology ever more to drive their competitive differentiation, technology intensity is rising and on a secular basis, the share of IT services within overall tech spending is also going up. I am confident that TCS’ best years are ahead, and I look forward to watching the company’s continued success from outside.

Best Regards,
Rajesh Gopinathan
Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director
(For FY 2022-23)

# Employee Volunteer Program

Our employee volunteer program called HOPE (Hours of Purpose by Employees) resulted in over 2.8 million hours of volunteering effort towards promoting issues most relevant in their local communities, such as mental health, climate action, circularity, education, skilling, mentoring, and conservation.

# Environmental Initiatives

On the environmental front, we continue to make good progress in our net zero journey. We have brought down our absolute carbon footprint across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 71% over base year 2016, meeting our target two years ahead of time. This was despite increased electricity consumption in FY 2023 from employees’ return to office. In addition to enterprise-wide initiatives for energy efficiency, we have also significantly increased our use of renewable energy. Renewable energy sources today make up 55% of the total (7.25% in 2016).



Letter from the CEO

Dear Shareholder,

I am truly humbled by this opportunity to lead this remarkable organization that I have been part of for 34 years. The culture, values and ethos of TCS and the Tata group have been an inspiration always. Your company has a very strong leadership team and a workforce that is highly motivated. It is my privilege to lead this talented team.

As part of the transition, I interacted with a number of our customers, leadership teams and employees. This has further enriched my understanding of the depth of our customer relationships, customers’ priorities and the opportunities ahead of us. I see a huge potential to create positive impact for our clients, our employees and for the broader community of stakeholders that we serve.

As part of their continuing digital transformation journey, we see sustained focus on cloud adoption, data architecture, customer experience and business model transformation. Through these initiatives, our customers intend to avoid technology obsolescence, become an intelligent enterprise, introduce new products and services, orchestrate ecosystems and provide immersive, hyper-personalized experiences. In addition, all our customers have also committed to ambitious net-zero carbon emission targets.

On top of these current focus areas, technologies like 5G, IoT, generative AI, virtual reality / metaverse, digital twin and others are also gaining attention and are likely to attract investments in the short to medium term.

As technology adoption will remain a key driver of business growth and transformation for our clients, we have been relentlessly focussed on our clients’ needs and have been investing in building newer capabilities to help them accelerate technology adoption. Your company continues to focus on enhancing the talent base of its associates, building partnerships with key technology providers, expanding the innovation ecosystem and building its own products and platforms.

These business and technology trends drove a strong deal flow throughout FY 2023, peaking in the fourth quarter. We closed the year with an order book of $34.1 Bn. This along with the strong pipeline replenishment gives us a good visibility for the medium term.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your continued support in this exciting journey ahead.

Best Regards,

K Krithivasan

Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director

Helping Versuni become a Digital-First, Innovation-Led Standalone Entity

Growth and transformation are often constrained by the challenge of integrating with the legacy operations stack, and the complexity that entails. So when health-tech giant Royal Philips sold Philips Domestic Appliances in 2021 to Hillhouse, a private equity firm, the standalone company, rebranded as Versuni, saw the separation as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to wipe the slate clean and transform into a digitally lean, agile, and innovation-led organization.

Versuni partnered with TCS in its transformation journey from strategy through execution, with a vision to embed insights and agility into core processes, enabling shorter time to value and quicker responses to market changes through a new cloud-first application landscape. The program entailed decoupling the company from the parent’s systems, while simultaneously transforming it across all business domains, within an ambitious 2-year timeframe.

Enhancements were made to deliver superior business outcomes across every function. Integrating supply chain planning with factory scheduling will enable higher warehouse productivity and more timely shipments. AI-powered insights in finance will help improve cash flow, free up cash and drive efficiencies in back-office functions. The new people processes will provide a better employee experience and enable a more responsive HR function.

The business transformation, enabled by SAP as the digital core, establishes best practices-based processes from the consumer products industry and simplified ways of working to drive speed, agility and insights-led decision-making. Partnering with TCS helped Versuni deploy a new digital foundation and operate as an independent entity. The new fit-for-purpose stack enables Versuni to more effectively respond to the fast-changing demands of the consumer products market, and pursue its vision of turning houses into homes, and building lifetime engagement with consumers.

I am really happy to have partnered with TCS in this journey. TCS has been an invaluable partner in our process and digital transformation journey with SAP as the main enabling technology suite. The hard work and dedication demonstrated by each member of the TCS team has not gone unnoticed. The leadership advisory services and commitment combined with the team’s domain and technology expertise is helping us get to our goals as an insights-led digital company.

Corine Adams
CIO, Versuni

TCS’ exceptional leadership, expertise, and flexibility combined with their passion and thorough understanding of our mission to become insights-led, makes them an outstanding partner. The TCS leadership team has been with us every step of the way. This transformation will help us continue to innovate and to stay true to our mission to turn houses into homes.

Enabling Eversource Energy’s Transition to a Green Energy Future

# Making green energy affordable is central to our business

Energy utilities are leading the world’s energy transition, investing in renewable energy sources as part of their journey to carbon neutrality. Leaders in the sector are using technology innovatively to draw environmentally conscious consumers looking for greener choices, and grow their new clean energy businesses.

Eversource Energy is a Fortune 500 energy company that operates New England’s largest energy delivery system, with 4.4 million customers across Connecticut (CT), Massachusetts (MA) and New Hampshire. It is focused on making its operations carbon neutral by 2030, and bringing more clean and affordable energy to New England.

Its technology enablement was a fairly complex program with multiple sub-programs running concurrently. TCS did an outstanding job in collaborating well with multiple stakeholders and managing risks very well. The TCS team’s contextual knowledge of the Eversource business and technology landscape resulted in a high quality solution that helped meet the regulatory mandate as well as Eversource’s clean energy and energy affordability goals.

# Eversource partnered with TCS

to build a solution that would help them on-board distributed solar power capacity within its grid by purchasing power from residential, industrial and commercial customers who install solar panels and storage on their properties, and enabling them to avail of incentives offered by their respective states, as part of state-level Net Zero programs.

The TCS-built solution includes onboarding of new solar customers, a customer application that helps keep track of the units generated, and a pricing engine that uses a declining block pricing mechanism to incentivize early enrolment as a producer. It also includes a billing system that processes recovery charges, solar credits and incentive payments, and enables flexible payment options as well as hardship relief options to improve affordability and increase adoption of energy efficiency programs.

To facilitate quick roll outs across states, TCS architected a reusable framework that would simplify adoption of each state’s incentive program into Eversource’s core platform, enabling the utility to pursue a very aggressive implementation schedule for each state.

Using this solution, Eversource has been able to leverage state incentives to make green energy affordable and rapidly benefit nearly 430,000 customers in CT and MA so far, while driving growth of its clean energy business. At the same time, it is projected to produce over 9,700 MWh of solar power, accelerating not only its own journey to carbon neutrality but also that of the states it services.

Innovate, Adapt, Thrive: A Fireside Chat

# K Ananth Krishnan

# Harrick Vin

# How does TCS help clients innovate, adapt and thrive?

KAK: With all the geo-political tension and economic uncertainty in today’s world, companies need to respond quickly to events on the ground and cope with surprises, while staying focused on fulfilling customer needs and wants, with innovative products and services.
TCS helps them on both these fronts. We help build a future-ready, digital core that enables quick, insights-driven decision making. We transform IT and business operating models using technology, making them more efficient, agile and responsive, freeing up resources to support innovation. Partnering with us enables our clients to try out a larger number of innovative ideas quickly, and launch new products, services and business models to drive growth and transformation.

Innovate, Adapt, Thrive refers to how our scale, full services capability and innovation offerings enable our clients to respond to short-term challenges while accelerating their pursuit of longer-term aspirations.

# Innovation is about having a lightbulb moment. How do you scale that?

HV: People often relate innovations to serendipitous discoveries. We help clients structure and scale the innovation process using the TCS Agile Innovation Cloud (AIC). This framework brings together the best of TCS’ talent, research and innovation inputs, global capabilities and ecosystem partnerships to scale up and speed up ‘Ideas to Outcomes’.

TCS MasterCraft™ is today used by hundreds of our clients for developing, transforming and maintaining model-based applications. In fact, our award-winning product suite, TCS BaNCS™, is written and maintained using MasterCraft.

For an insurance major, we worked with the client’s teams and collated actionable innovation ideas through a series of brainstorming workshops using the Clay Map. Leveraging our AIC, we rapidly built POCs every quarter, some of which got turned into MVPs and rolled out across the enterprise. In just eight months, dozens of innovation ideas were identified, and 24 progressed to become MVPs.

The new low code, no code platforms have done away even with those overheads. Their graphical drag and drop user interface empowers people with no coding knowledge to build sophisticated applications very quickly.

One reason for this high yield is that our teams leverage their contextual knowledge, learned over years spent immersed in the client’s IT and business landscape, to come up with ideas deeply rooted in that organization’s reality and therefore more likely to succeed.

# Generative AI is the talk of the season. What is the business opportunity around it?

KAK: We see interest in exploring use cases right across the enterprise. The most obvious areas are conversational systems, content creation and digital marketing, and activities which require processing of large amounts of unstructured data, text, images and higher-level abstraction.

And yet, none of this has led to any demand compression. It has only led to more growth. We believe generative AI will be no different. Like prior breakthrough technologies, it will sharply bring down the effort per function point, driving up programmer productivity immensely. This will result in greater consumption, with volume growth more than making up for the effort deflation.

Innovate, Adapt, Thrive: A Fireside Chat | 28



# What is the evidence for this thesis?

HV: The evidence is empirical. Every new generation of technology has led to reduction in programming effort per function point. But while that has steadily fallen, aggregate spending on IT services has only risen year after year, over decades.

platform launched in 2009, with shared services bundled in, went on to make us the market leader in life and pensions administration in the UK.

Historically, gaining leadership in IT services on any new technology required just training sufficient numbers of people in that technology, ahead of market demand. In the last decade, we not only did that at scale on the entire class of digital technologies, but also invested in higher order capabilities so we could advise our clients on how best to harness the combinatorial power of new technologies in their specific business context.

Take for example, the switch from assembly language to C. Its compilers came with large, extensible libraries of reusable pre-defined procedures. A developer could invoke a procedure with one line of code in C and embed its entire logic in the code base, without actually coding all of it from scratch. Three lines of C accomplished what took 30 lines in assembly language. The 10x effort deflation didn’t result in mass layoffs of programmers. Instead, there was an explosion in software development because the same IT team could now build ten times as many function points.

Similarly, enterprises adopted offshore outsourcing, it led to a big cost deflation, but nobody’s IT budgets deflated. Instead, those savings went into building new systems and volumes rose to fill budgets and spending on IT services has only expanded. We are helping clients explore and develop end-to-end scenarios in combining technologies like quantum computing, generative AI, 5G and the emerging 6G, and new concepts in cyber security. Here in India, we have stitched together a fully indigenous network stack for 4G and 5G, a unique achievement that differentiates us from our global peers.

KAK: With most goods and services, when the price falls, any increase in volume is limited by how much of that good or service the market can consume in a defined period. When farm mechanization reduced the cost of tilling, the increased demand for men in tractors was not large enough to compensate for the effort deflation because there was only so much land available to till.

Demand for IT services behaves differently. In every enterprise, there is significant unmet demand. Every CIO has limited capacity for new system development, resulting in a requirement backlog that never gets fulfilled. Technologies like generative AI or low code-no code can help a CIO expand capacity and accomplish much more with the same budget. But even then, the backlog never goes away because there is no limit on business users’ ingenuity or competitive drive. Demand just rises to fill the incremental capacity created by new technologies.

HV: On the cloud, the biggest technology trend in recent years, we were one of the earliest to set up dedicated business units for each of the three leading hyperscaler clouds. Our early investments in building deep expertise and a large portfolio of innovative cloud-native solutions helped us capture tremendous growth and gain share.

We are today one of the largest partners – in some cases, the largest partner – to each of those providers, in terms of number of employees with certifications, volumes of workloads migrated to the cloud and in number of solutions and intellectual property on their platforms.

HV: The emergence of new technologies triggers more ideas, experimentation and more demand for our services. To that extent, business application of generative AI, along with other technologies, will itself drive the incremental demand that fills up the capacity it frees up through higher productivity. Indian IT companies are seen as fast followers on new technologies. Will that change with generative AI?

KAK: We have been leaders for a while, but perceptions can be too rooted in historic stereotypes to recognize the change. Back in 2008, when the term SaaS was still new, we had built a subscription-based, single instance, multi-tenant core banking platform using TCS BaNCS for small banks in India. A similar model is powering start-up banks in Israel today.

# Revolutionizing Small Value Payments in South Africa

BankservAfrica, Africa’s leading automated clearing house, has been facilitating payments in South Africa and the region, for over five decades through its seamless interbank clearing and settlement services. It has a track record of pioneering innovations like the SASWITCH, a national network of interoperable ATMs, in the mid-80s.

When the South African Reserve Bank unveiled its Vision 2025 strategy to reform the South African national payment system framework, BankservAfrica took the lead along with its ecosystem partners, and engaged TCS to build a new platform for rapid payments that would usher in the era of modern, cost-effective, instant digital payments on the continent. On the front-end, users can make a payment, or a request for payment, through a payment service called PayShap, formally launched in March 2023. Very conveniently, users don’t need to enter the recipient’s bank account or branch code details to make payments. Instead, they can use a unique identifier such as the recipient’s mobile number, or a bank-generated identification number, which serves as a proxy for the full banking details. This proxy and resolution is enabled through a tamper-proof blockchain-based solution powered by TCS’ Quartz Smart Solution.

TCS designed a high availability, containerized, cloud optimized solution with TCS BaNCS for Market Infrastructure at its core, using high performance microservices for clearing and payment. Hosted on a public cloud, the solution is very resilient and can auto-scale.

By democratizing access to a frictionless system for low value payments, TCS’ innovative solution for BankservAfrica has the potential to reduce the use of cash for small transactions and accelerate formalization of the unorganized sector. It will drive new fee-based revenues for banks, and also offer customer insights with which they can offer credit to more consumers. This will not only improve financial inclusion, but also add to South Africa’s GDP growth – a fitting outcome for two very purpose-driven organizations that came together to build this platform of national importance.

BankservAfrica views cost-effective digital payments as a pathway to improving credit access and financial inclusion in South Africa. After an extensive evaluation, we selected TCS for their deep understanding of the payments ecosystem, global experience, technological expertise, intellectual property and shared values. The outcome has been very gratifying. By changing consumer behaviors, PayShap has the potential to reshape sectors and transform the South African economy.

Supporting Takenaka Corporation Realize

We selected TCS for supporting our digital transformation not only because of its accumulated global knowledge and technological capabilities, but also because throughout the long histories of both companies, there is a common bond in our corporate cultures of valuing stakeholders, including society and customers as well as employees. Building 4.0 will turn the dreams of our stakeholders into reality, and we would like to develop it as a foundation to connect with a sustainable society of the future.

Founded by a master builder (toryo) more than 400 years ago, Takenaka Corporation has specialized in building construction with an integrated design-build approach that includes initial planning and aftercare services like maintenance. It has redefined urban landscapes in Japan and around the world, with famous landmarks like Tokyo Tower and Changi International Airport. At the core of its longstanding business success is its passion for innovation rooted in its toryo spirit, quality management, and its commitment to realizing a sustainable society.

Takenaka’s Vision for 2030 aims to realize a fourth industrial revolution in the building industry by embracing digital transformation across the construction value chain. It is addressing key problems facing the industry in Japan, such as labor shortage, by using digital technologies to increase employee productivity and improve the work-life balance of employees. Its innovation initiatives include AI-based design and construction planning, next-generation work sites with construction robots and remotely operated cranes, and environmentally conscious smart buildings with intelligent controls using IoT. The foundation for this innovation is the Building 4.0ᵀᴹ digital platform, which is being developed and operated in partnership with TCS.

Building 4.0ᵀᴹ will integrate data from sales, design, estimation, engineering, construction management, facilities management services, human resources and accounting. This will enable superior decision-making across a wide range of operations through advanced analysis using machine learning and AI. In building design, for example, structural engineers can use AI-based cross-section estimations to more efficiently implement optimal structural designs. In construction, it can enable better construction planning using accurate forecasts of materials and personnel required to achieve target schedules, improve visibility of project progress, and enhance labor productivity.

TCS is supporting Takenaka in promoting innovation, building construction digital twins, simulating human behavior, utilizing knowledge of the construction field, and exploring “what-if” scenarios. The knowledge gained from these efforts will help Takenaka develop comprehensive and sustainable solutions through better designs, understand project risks, and improve KPIs for quality, cost, schedule, safety, and the environment.

Through Building 4.0ᵀᴹ, Takenaka will continue to create new value for society and customers while improving business efficiency. It will also contribute to the realization of a sustainable society enabling new architecture and urban creation services that is in harmony with the environment and local communities.

Q&#x26;A with
Samir Seksaria     Milind Lakkad
CFO                CHRO

You stood out in the industry with virtually zero attrition at senior levels. Now you had CEO-level attrition for the first time in your history. What does this say about your retention of senior talent?

ML: One swallow does not a summer make. This unprecedented event at TCS is just a reminder that CEOs are human too, and might want to pursue their dreams and aspirations just like anybody else. As for our track record in retaining senior leadership talent, it remains industry-leading.

I am proud to say that almost the entire team of 25 business heads we had created in 2008 is still in TCS. We have over 125,000 TCSers today with an average tenure of over 10 years in TCS. This cohort represents the true strength of TCS. They are the custodians of our culture, values and institutional memory, and have been central to our ability to weather the unprecedented attrition and influx of fresh talent without letting it affect the high quality of project outcomes that our clients have come to expect from TCS.

We not only retained our leadership talent better, but also expanded the leadership pool six-fold in the last five years by incubating a next generation of leaders running sub-ISUs, with P&#x26;L responsibilities. The breadth and depth of our leadership bench today makes our succession planning an industry benchmark, with multiple equally-qualified successors for any leadership position, starting from the CEO down, as you recently witnessed.

Is normalizing attrition a margin tailwind for FY 2024? What is your margin outlook for the year?

SS: Normalizing attrition is definitely a relief, but I wouldn’t call it a tailwind. We incurred a 1.4% margin headwind in FY 2023 from backfilling and retention expenses. If we onboarded a lateral hire at a 20% premium during the year, that increase in employee cost is a recurring one. But yes, hopefully we won’t have any new headwind due to attrition in FY 2024.

Also, with the supply-side challenges easing, incremental cost of hiring laterals should be lower, and it also gives us an opportunity to bring down subcontractor expense. That is one important margin lever for FY 2024. Utilization improvement, flatter employee pyramid and hopefully, currency support, are the other levers. On the other hand, we will have our usual wage increase in Q1 and we should see further increases in travel expenses during the year.

You won many large outsourcing deals in FY 2023, and your highest ever number of large deals in Q4. Won’t this hurt margins in FY 2024?

SS: It is not true that large outsourcing deals are necessarily margin dilutive. A few high profile mega-deals in the industry whose low quality revenues impacted margins have resulted in that perception. In the last five years, TCS has won several mega deals with TCV over $500 million, and every year we win dozens of large deals, with TCV over $50 million. And yet, during this period, our EBIT margin has remained in a tight band between 24 and 26 percent.

Profitability of large deals depends on how you construct them. A client might push for a certain amount of absolute cost reduction at the time of contract renewal. The service provider can either drop prices and sacrifice margins to deliver those

Q&#x26;A | 32




savings, or propose a completely different operating model that uses lesser effort, protects or even expands margins, and achieves the client’s objectives.

TCS has differentiated itself in this space with the latter approach. Its win-win propositions reimagine the customer’s operating model, leveraging AI and machine learning to reduce human intervention while improving process velocity and operational resilience. Customers have really taken to this idea. In FY 2023, we signed 29 large operating model transformation deals, covering business as well as IT operations, compared to 18 in the prior year.

# Attrition among women is higher than for men. Why? How are you addressing this?

ML: Historically, women’s attrition at TCS has been similar or lower than men’s attrition, so this is unusual. There might be other reasons but intuitively, I would think working from home during the pandemic reset the domestic arrangements for some women, keeping them from returning to office even after everything normalized.

The higher attrition among women in FY 2023 is a setback to our efforts to promote gender diversity but we are doubling down on it. Focused leadership development programs like iExcel are driving tremendous change. Of all the leadership positions fulfilled with internal candidates in FY 2023, women made up 23% of the selected candidates, even though they account for only 14% of the applicant pool. This speaks well of the quality of the women candidates in our leadership pool as well as the supportive attitudes of our business leaders in promoting diversity. Likewise, in our external hiring, women make up 38.1% of our net hires this year, versus 35.7% in our workforce.

# Will sticky onsite inflation be a structural headwind for your margins?

SS: In the short term, higher onsite wage inflation is a headwind because our legacy contracts have much lower cost of living adjustments written in. But in the medium and longer term, this will get adjusted. Wage inflation affects everybody in the market including the clients themselves. Newer contracts reflect the changed cost structure for onsite effort. Also, contractual terms now peg annual cost of living increases to prevailing inflation rates. That should help mitigate inflation risks in longer term contracts.

Without the inflation differential, the Rupee may show greater strength than in the past. How will your margins sustain then?

SS: Inflation differential is not the only driver of currency depreciation. Rupee is also affected by India’s trade deficit, interest rate differentials and capital movements. But for argument’s sake, let us assume that we may not have the benefit of currency depreciation in the future. Now remember, the currency depreciation basically helps us offset wage inflation in India which historically, we never passed on to clients. In the changed circumstances, this too will get baked into new contracts the same way onsite wage inflation has been. So in the longer term, we should be able to sustain our current margins.

# Why is Return to Office so important to TCS? Why not let employees continue to work from home?

ML: Work from home is definitely more convenient for everybody, but there were drawbacks. Tenured employees who are well networked within the organization can work effectively and even collaborate virtually using the social capital built up over the years. That isn’t the case with more junior employees. Workplace essentials like collaboration, mentorship and team-building suffered a lot in these two years.

Then there is the matter of organizational culture. Over half our workforce today was hired after March 2020. New employees get acculturated through physical interactions with senior colleagues and leaders, by observing and following their behaviors and ways of thinking. Without those interactions, employee engagement as well as acculturation got badly impacted. All these factors led us to gradually bring back people to our offices during the year.

# With laterals brought in at higher salaries, how do you manage the wage gaps between individuals of similar profile doing similar work?

ML: Yes, this is another unusual, industry-wide problem. The pay disparities will eventually go away for two reasons. Clients’ IT teams – can change relative competitiveness and by extension, margins. Margin improvement is possible from selling higher-priced growth and transformation solutions which use generative AI. Likewise, new software products or platforms which use generative AI to deliver superior business outcomes.

# Innovating to Improve Crop Yields and Farmer Incomes

With climate change, agriculture is increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather events, inconsistent rainfall, as well as increased pest and disease outbreaks. This affects crop yields, farmer incomes and food security.

Rallis India Ltd, a leading agri-input company, partnered with TCS for the first field deployment of the new platform, to improve the productivity of its hybrid seed production farms, as well as for internal business planning. Branded Drishti (“Vision”), the platform is used to monitor approximately 130 million hectares of agricultural land across India, for various aspects such as crop productivity, soil moisture, early alerts for pest outbreak, as well as seasonal weather anomalies and extreme weather events. The platform has helped Rallis increase the field scouting efficiency of its hybrid seed production team, and improved yield by 1 to 2%.

TCS built a digital platform to empower the Indian farmer and improve the resilience of the nation’s farming sector. The TCS Digital Platform for Next Generation Agriculture (DNA) is a state-of-the-art, cloud-based decision intelligence and crop monitoring system that provides customized, site-specific predictive advisory services to farmers and other players in the food value chain.

TCS DNA uses an innovative Sky-Earth convergence, intelligently fusing remote-sensing data from earth observation satellites and drones with data from proximal sensors and handheld devices on the field. This gives scale and reduces cost significantly without sacrificing accuracy. Proprietary AI/ML algorithms are utilized to analyze the data and provide reliable information and predictive intelligence on weather, soil condition, crop health, and pest forecasts. Farmers can use these insights to make quicker and more informed decisions, optimize production costs and improve their yield.

TCS DNA is also helping Amalgamation Plantations, the second largest producer of tea in India, improve the quality and sustainability of tea leaves procured from small tea growers. It is being used to remotely monitor various aspects of small plantations using satellite imagery, predict pest and disease and improve quality. This is expected to help small tea growers improve their income by 15% and reduce rejections by 20%.

Our partnership with TCS is helping us alleviate the issues of farmers and agriculture. The Drishti platform identifies problem areas and offers actionable insights to farmers in India, leading to effective crop management by reducing the risks and minimizing the loss in yield.

Global GDP in FY 2023 was affected by the Russia-Ukraine war and resultant dislocations in supply chains, leading to surging food and energy inflation. Central banks raised interest rates sharply in response. As a result, the global GDP is estimated to have grown at a more subdued 3.4% in 2022, versus 5.9% in the prior year1.

Global technology spending on Enterprise software and IT services crossed the $2 trillion2 mark in 2022, growing 5.5% YoY. IT services grew 3.5% YoY, to $1,250 billion. This growth was led by accelerated cloud adoption, preference for external expertise due to severe talent scarcity, and expanding scope of digital transformation to cover more back-office operational areas.

The global IT services industry continues to be a highly fragmented one, with even the largest provider having a mid-single digit market share. TCS is among the largest IT services providers globally, with a market share of 2.2%, and has outperformed the market, growing significantly higher than market growth over the last decade.

TCS has been broadening and deepening customer relationships by continually looking for new opportunities and newer areas in their businesses to add value, proactively investing in building newer capabilities, reskilling its workforce and launching newer services, solutions, products and platforms to address those opportunities.

The Pace Ports at Pittsburgh in the US, in the Carnegie Mellon University campus, and the other in Toronto, Canada, were formally inaugurated this year. Including the ones in Tokyo, New York and Amsterdam, the company has five Pace Ports in all.

The company launched joint innovation hubs as well, using the TCS Pace™ framework. TCS and Boots launched an agile incubator called INNOVATE Powered by TCS Pace™, at Boots’ Nottingham headquarters in the UK. TCS forged a major applied engineering and research partnership with The National Robotarium, UK’s largest and most advanced AI and robotics research centre, located at Heriot-Watt University’s Edinburgh campus.

These growth and transformation (G&#x26;T) engagements are higher value engagements catering to the needs of a broader set of stakeholders in the client organization, enjoying greater visibility within the CXO suite and more closely aligned with their business strategy. An expanding share of this business is helping drive a steady increase in the scope and scale of services consumed year after year, and an expansion of TCS’ share of wallet, as evidenced by the client metrics.

Over time, this strategy has resulted in deep and enduring customer relationships, a vibrant and engaged workforce, industry-leading profitability, a steady expansion of the addressable market, and a proven track record in delivering longer term stakeholder value.

TCS’ dedicated practice units around AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform have been steadily investing in training, certifications, credentials and in building solutions and intellectual property on their respective hyperscaler stacks.

# Business Outlook

Global growth is projected to moderate from 3.4 percent in 2022 to 2.8 percent in 2023, weighed down by central banks raising interest rates to fight inflation, and Russia’s war in Ukraine. In major economies, the heightened risk of a recession – made worse by a banking crisis – has led to uncertainty in enterprise decision-making, affecting spending on capex and certain discretionary programs.

FY 2023, at $34.1 Bn, which is 1.2 times revenue. The pipeline has also grown well. This provides visibility on medium-term growth amid near-term uncertainty. If the delayed decision-making and cash conservation seen in some segments at the end of FY 2023 flows over into the first half of FY 2024, that could result in some moderation in full year revenue growth after two years of strong growth.

Despite this, spending on IT services has been resilient so far. Cloud migration programs are continuing apace, and clients continue to launch new G&#x26;T projects. The higher level of uncertainty in the business environment has made clients more receptive to proactive proposals around IT and business operating model transformations that can not only deliver significant efficiencies but also help them become more agile and resilient. All this has resulted in a strong order book for FY 2024.

# Key demand drivers expected to power the company’s growth in FY 2024 include:

- Technology transformation: IT infrastructure modernization, cloud enablement, application and data estate modernization, cloud migration, data centre and collocated data support, digital workplace, digital twins, cyber security, ERP modernization, low-code no-code, 5G/Edge and AI adoption.

# Enterprise Risk Management

FY 2023 saw multiple external and internal challenges continuing to shape the overall risk profile of the company. Macroeconomic and geo-political risks had an impact throughout the year. The Russia-Ukraine war and geo-political tensions, trade wars and imposed sanctions were pervasive and had direct and cascading impacts on economies and businesses. Shortages, rising inflation, supply-chain disruptions, energy crisis led to further uncertainties in the economic growth environment, with the year ending with banking industry upheavals in US and Europe. During the year, IT organizations including TCS faced the knock-on effects of the pandemic including attrition and impact of hybrid modes of working. Technological advancements and breakthroughs like generative AI and metaverse have opened up new vistas of both risks and opportunities.

TCS continues to monitor this uncertain and dynamic business environment very closely and has strengthened the deployment of its Enterprise Risk Management framework to address the risks and leverage the associated opportunities. This framework enables risk identification, risk assessment, risk response planning and actions, risk monitoring and overall risk governance. Key risk indicators and control indicators are used to anticipate risks and assess effectiveness of their mitigation actions respectively.

TCS takes a holistic view of its enterprise risk profile, covering strategic, operational, compliance, financial and catastrophic risks, thus enabling informed decision-making. Risks are assessed and managed at various levels with a top-down and bottom-up approach across the enterprise, business units, geographies, business functions, customer relationships and individual projects.

| Volatile global political and economic environment (R) | * Geo-politics and macroeconomic volatility can affect demand for the company’s services. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has led to supply chain disruptions, energy crisis, food and merchandise scarcities and related inflation.
* Persistent high inflation in major economies could affect consumer spending and fuel social unrest. Repeated interest rate hikes by central banks to rein in the inflation could result in economic slowdowns.
* Continuing turmoil in the banking sector could affect not only spending in that sector, but also squeeze liquidity.
* All of these could affect clients’ business outlook and result in reduced demand for TCS’ services. It could also increase TCS’ costs of doing business.
* In addition, there could be risks to service delivery, business continuity, cybersecurity, sanctions compliance and human rights risks in geo-politically sensitive zones, all of which could increase costs or affect the company’s revenue growth. | - Broad-based business mix, well diversified across geographies and industry verticals.

# TCS’ Approach

TCS’ policy on Appointment of Directors and Board Diversity can be found at https://on.tcs.com/appointment-BoD.

Board independence is ensured by having an independent majority, with 5 independent directors out of 9 i.e., 55.6 percent. None of the independent directors is related to each other, or to the non-independent directors. Average tenure of independent directors is 6 years.

Board effectiveness is further improved by ensuring that none of the directors holds directorships in more than seven listed entities, and none of the executive directors serves as an independent director on the Boards of more than three listed entities.

TCS’ governance philosophy around minority shareholders’ interests is guided by the TCoC which emphasizes fairness and transparency to all stakeholders. Further a qualified, diverse and independent Board ensures that minority shareholders’ interests are protected.

TCS strives to reduce information asymmetry through transparency, extensive disclosures and detailed commentary of the demand environment and the state of the business, and material developments. The Company provides a variety of channels including a structured global investor outreach program, through which minority shareholders can interact with the management or the Board.

Shareholders can communicate concerns and grievances to the Company Secretary’s office through a well-publicized channel, where complaints are tracked till closure. The Stakeholders’ Relationship Committee oversees the redressal of these complaints.

# Avoidance of conflict of interest

Chairmanship⁴ of the Board is a non-executive position, and separate from that of the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director (CEO and MD).

TCoC⁵ for non-executive directors, and for independent directors, carries explicit clauses covering avoidance of conflict of interest. Likewise, it explicitly prohibits any employee – including the executive directors – from accepting any position of responsibility, with or without remuneration, with any other organization without TCS’ prior written approval. For the executive directors, such approval must be obtained from the Board.

# Values, Ethics and compliance

Over the last five decades, TCS has consistently demonstrated very principled conduct and has earned its reputation for trust and integrity while building a highly successful global business. The Company’s core values are: Leading Change, Integrity, Respect for the Individual, Excellence, and Learning and Sharing.

The TCoC serves as a moral guide and a governing framework for responsible corporate citizenship. It sets out guidelines on various topics including respect for human rights, prohibition of bribery and corruption, recognition of employees’ freedom of association, and avoidance of conflicts of interest.

Every employee of the Company is required to sign the TCoC at the time of joining. Web-based annual refresher courses are mandated to ensure continued awareness of the Code. Further, frequent communications from the leadership, reiterate the importance of the company values and the TCoC.

Customers are made aware of the TCoC principles in contract discussions, and through inclusion of specific clauses in proposals and contracts.

Employees also undergo Web-based mandatory training every year on Anti-bribery and ethical behaviour. They can raise ethics concerns on Ultimatix – the intranet portal of the Company, which are investigated and tracked to closure by the HR department. Employees and other stakeholders can also report any non-compliance to the TCoC or to the laws of the land by senior executives directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee under the Whistle blower Policy without fear of retaliation. Information about these channels is communicated to employees as part of the mandatory training modules.

# TCS’ Approach

Compliance to laws of the countries in which we operate, as well as global legislation such as Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Bribery Act, 2010, etc. are monitored through formal compliance procedures led by the Corporate compliance office. Changes to legislation are closely monitored, risks are evaluated and effectively managed across the business operations. Governance, Risk and Compliance are overseen by the Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Risk Officer and the Chief HR Officer who report to the Chief Operating Officer and Executive Director (COO and ED), and CEO and MD respectively. At the apex level, the Audit Committee headed by an Independent Director oversees compliance to the TCoC, Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy, Gift and Hospitality Policy and also to the external regulations.

# Tax Strategy7

TCS is committed to comply with the applicable laws and regulations, and believes in reporting to the respective tax authorities, relevant information that is complete and accurate, in a timely manner. TCS does not engage in aggressive and contrived tax planning or tax structuring for the purpose of gaining tax advantages. TCS’s tax policy is to optimize the tax cost, avail tax incentives where available, while achieving 100 per cent compliance with the spirit as well as the letter of the tax laws and regulations in all countries in which it operates. Compliance is achieved through a robust compliance reporting and monitoring process, with a strong governance on minimizing the tax risk. TCS has zero tolerance towards tax evasion, or the facilitation of tax evasion, by itself or by its employees or vendors. TCS maintains open and collaborative relationships with governments and tax authorities worldwide. Where appropriate, TCS seeks advance clearance from tax authorities on the proposed tax treatment of transactions, helping pre-empt future disputes.

# Board Oversight of Sustainability Matters8

TCS’ approach to sustainable growth is built on the belief that it can expand its business by creating longer term value for all its stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers and local communities, while also valuing the environment. The various sustainability topics material to TCS are overseen by the relevant Board committees, as outlined below:

# Succession planning

TCS’ philosophy of empowering employees, its industry-leading talent retention, and an organization structure that devolves executive decision-making across the three business groups (viz., Relationship Incubation group, Enterprise Growth group and Business Transformation group) have resulted in a large and deep bench of leadership talent that enables robust succession planning and continuity and consistency in strategy. Succession planning for the top two leadership positions in each business unit is reviewed by senior management. Additionally, heads of business units carry out succession planning for key functions within their units. Succession planning at senior management levels is reviewed by the Board. Business or unit heads are invited to present on specific topics at Board meetings from time to time, offering an opportunity to the directors to assess their values, competencies, and capabilities.

Remuneration Policy

# Remuneration Policy

The remuneration policy of the Company is designed to create a high-performance culture. It enables the Company to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve results. Our business model promotes customer centricity and requires employee mobility to address project needs.

The remuneration policy supports such mobility through pay models that are compliant to local regulations. In each country where the Company operates, the remuneration structure is tailored to the regulations, practices and benchmarks prevalent in the IT industry.

The Company pays remuneration by way of salary, benefits, perquisites and allowances (fixed component) and commission (variable component) to its Managing Director and the Executive Directors. Annual increments are recommended by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee within the salary scale approved by the Board and Members and are effective April 1, each year.

The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, decides the commission payable to the Managing Director and the Executive Directors out of the profits for the financial year and within the ceilings prescribed under the Act, based on the Board evaluation process considering the criteria such as the performance of the Company as well as that of the Managing Director and each Executive Director.

The Company pays sitting fees of `30,000 per meeting to its Non-Executive Directors for attending meetings of the Board and meetings of committees of the Board. The Company also pays commission to the Non-Executive Directors within the ceiling of 1 percent of the net profits of the Company as computed under the applicable provisions of the Act, with the approval of the Members. The said commission is decided each year by the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and distributed amongst the Non-Executive Directors based on the Board evaluation process, considering criteria such as their attendance and contribution at the Board and Committee meetings, as well as the time spent on operational matters other than at meetings. The Company also reimburses the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Directors for attending the meetings. The Remuneration policy is available on https://on.tcs.com/remuneration-policy.

# LaaS Case Study

Pyari Ben resides in the Bijori hamlet of Puwasa village, in Madhya Pradesh’s Alirajpur district, one of the least literate and poorest districts in the country. Due to limited local employment prospects, villagers from Alirajpur travel for work to nearby Gujarat cities; Pyari is not an exception in this regard. She never had the opportunity to attend school, so she never achieved literacy. This became difficult because she couldn’t keep track of her hard-earned daily income as a construction worker.

She gained basic literacy skills after joining the Literacy as a Service (LaaS) program, which made her realize that her contractor used to defraud her by not paying her the proper wages. LaaS gave her the awareness she needed to fight for her rights and ultimately get her dues. She can now calculate her working hours and daily pay, create a budget, and save money. She created a bank account and enrolled in Ayushman Bharat, a health insurance scheme, to obtain medical benefits for herself and her family. As a migrant who travels from her village to distant work locations, she can now read and recognize train numbers to board the correct train. Pyari inspired other women in the village and encouraged them to participate in this program.

# Literacy as a Service

Adult non-literacy continues to be a problem holding back India from reaching its full economic potential. Women account for 65% of the illiterate population, and the rest is from marginalized communities. To address the causes of non-literacy, TCS devised the Literacy as a Service Program (LaaS) which augments the Government of India’s efforts to improve literacy. LaaS provides an innovative teaching method by combining the power of IT with the theory of cognition and laws of perception. LaaS adopts creative means of delivery to enable functional literacy, such as animated graphic patterns for easy visual and auditory learning.

# Modules on the platform include:

- Functional literacy (8-10 hours)
- Digital literacy (5-7 hours)
- Awareness on key citizen rights

# Ignite My Future (IMF)

Ignite My Future is a teacher professional development program which introduces the concept of computational thinking into all core subjects. This is a transdisciplinary education program that transforms the way students learn. IMF has generated a great impact through professional development offerings, special projects as well as volunteer and customer engagements with the partnered schools. IMF’s Learning Leaders community supports the growing global community of partnered educators, committed to learnings about the power of computational thinking. This year, IMF India launched Learning Leaders’ regional chapters, catering to regional learning requirements of the teachers from the partner districts across India.




One of the IMF’s pioneering STEM initiative interventions, Global Innovations Project (GIP) aims to connect students and teachers from around the world as they explore and solve real-world problems using computational thinking.

This year, IMF India has launched its Season 1 of GIP, where students were asked to explore accessible and adaptive tools, identify and problem-solve community level issues that are limiting the accessibility and inclusivity of all the learners. Teachers and students from schools like School of Scholars (Maharashtra), BGS Schools (Karnataka), Podar International School (Maharashtra), Rajya Ashram Paddhati Vidyalaya (Samaj Kalyan Department, Uttar Pradesh), APSWREIS (Andhra Pradesh) in India have collaborated with schools from North America in this experiential journey.

Overall, the participants from India worked on 109 innovation projects, clocking over 560 collaborative learning hours and 268 videos over Microsoft Flip tool. Teachers were very appreciative of the opportunity to learn and collaborate with educators around the world.

In FY 2023, IMF benefited more than 293,000 students and educators across North America, India, UK and Ireland, APAC and ANZ.

# IMF Case Study

This year, Ignite My Future made its impact through professional development, volunteer and customer engagement and special projects. One such collaboration was with the Meghe Group of Schools to encourage students for an interest in STEM and computational thinking.

# goIT Case Study

Speaking about her experience at the first inaugural TCS goIT program in Saudi Arabia, Leah, a Grade 7 student, said, “I am super happy to have had the opportunity to get involved in the design thinking program. The mobile app training is cool, and I am proud of my project on improving world health by using technology.”

The event was celebrated with more than 100 learners from the Al Sahafa International School, Riyadh. Under the theme of UN SDG, students ideated solutions for good health and wellbeing, affordable and clean energy, and zero hunger.

Grade 7 students prototyped a mobile solution called ‘Team Earth’ which displays the location of the nearest renewable energy outlets and finds an environmental, social, and governance volunteer. Meanwhile, Grade 5 students pitched a technology solution to solve world hunger by creating an app called ‘Free Supermarket’ which would help people make and receive donations.

Excited to see the STEM exposure students received through the TCS goIT program, the Academic Coordinator of Al Sahafa International School, Ola Mourad said, “Programs like this are extremely important in showing students how they can succeed in a range of fields, with a good grounding in IT.”

# goIT

TCS’ flagship program goIT (go Innovate Together) is a Digital Innovation program which prepares students with culturally relevant and context-appropriate learning experiences, coupled with modern technologies.

Across the world, the gap between employers’ needs and available skills is growing. The National Science Foundation predicts that 80% of the jobs that will be created in the next decade will require a form of mathematics and science skilling. Insufficient numbers of students pursuing these streams, and lack of focus on innovation, problem-solving and creativity in school curricula, are the big challenges in fulfilling those future jobs.

# BridgeIT

BridgeIT is a unique initiative created to bridge the digital divide that places socially and economically underprivileged communities at a disadvantage. The program creates digital entrepreneurs who use IT to help local citizens avail essential digital services in education, adult literacy, unemployment and social discrimination. It attempts to address prevailing social inequities in India by proactively reaching out to women, Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (SC/ST) communities.

Launched in 2014, BridgeIT has a footprint across 30 districts in 10 states. The program offers budding entrepreneurs the skills, mentoring, technology, tools and resources required to set up a Digital Service Centre from where they can provide services such as:

| Education | Adult Literacy | Unemployment | Social Discrimination |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------ | --------------------- |





as generating and updating documents (such as Aadhar cards, Pan cards, and voters ID), enrolling for different government schemes, filling in online forms and cash withdrawals/deposits from the bank to fellow villagers.

In FY 2023, the program had 347 active digital entrepreneurs providing several of these services in 1,735 villages. 146 of these entrepreneurs were women.

# BridgeIT Case Study

Priyanka Kumari, a native of Dihi village, Latehar District, Jharkhand, had never dreamt that one day she would be an entrepreneur and earn an income of more than `40,000/-per month. Priyanka always had a desire to have her own identity. When she got married, she was still doing her graduation. She continued her studies after marriage and completed her graduation in 2016. In 2020, when she heard of BridgeIT she grabbed the opportunity to be part of the program.

Gradually, she became a successful digital entrepreneur and is now providing several services such as photocopying, printing, taking and printing passport size photos, paying land taxes, booking railway tickets, Aadhaar, PAN Card and Ration card services, etc. Today, Priyanka not only runs a shop near her residence, she also has taken up the responsibility of another shop at the Panchayat Bhawan of her village, employing two other people from the village.

BridgeIT has inspired her to dream big and is successfully supporting Priyanka in achieving her plans for future. She says, “My dream is to expand my business further and I want to keep the latest models of mobile phones and other accessories for sale in my shop. Moreover, I also want to open a tent house employing more needy people in the business. Besides, I am planning to buy a new scooty.”

# Youth Employment Program (YEP)

YEP tackles one of the biggest challenges in India – unemployment among youth, especially those from marginalized sections of society, due to lack of 21st century skills. YEP provides employability training, imparting skills such as business communication, aptitude, computer programming and domain skills with the help of subject matter experts, domain leaders, and certified trainers from TCS.

The program offers participants a smooth transition from college to careers, building their confidence and enhancing their social and economic status through its unique teach, coach, mentor, and place model. It helps them navigate opportunities available in the Indian job market with career guidance and mentoring.

In FY 2023, more than 31,000 students were trained across India, of which 57% were women and 17% from the groups qualifying for affirmative action programs. Over 10,000 students have gained employment in the IT/ITES, banking, retail fields.

# YEP Case Study

Preeti Diwakar was born and brought up at Panipat in Haryana, and later her family shifted to Kaushambi in Uttar Pradesh. Her father worked as a helper at local grocery shops while her mother supported with household chores in neighborhood. Their meagre income barely put food on the table for the family of five.

Preeti had to fight hard in her pursuit of education. She funded her own education by taking up tuitions and borrowing course books from senior students in school. While pursuing BCom at University of Allahabad, she discovered a strong desire to learn about the intricacies of stock market, and later taught her classmates. But she had neither the funds to invest nor the confidence to speak about it. She also lacked clarity on career goals or available job prospects.

TCS Youth Employability Program brought a ray of sunshine to her gloomy worldview. During the Covid years, Preeti not only learned math and reasoning skills, she also worked on her overall personality. She learnt from her trainer, the importance of public speaking, projecting confidence in online interviews, and active listening. In the TCS NQT exam later that year, she scored 77.39% and got placed in December ’21.

She launched a website and her first YouTube channel “Commerce Stocking” about stock market investment tips. In December’22, she quit her job and became an entrepreneur, launching her dream website for educating people on the financial sector. In her own words, it was TCS’ YEP which enabled her to find her own voice and she has been following it all along since then.



Social Innovation

Digital Impact Square (DISQ) is a social innovation platform established in 2015 in Nashik, Maharashtra. The platform encourages innovation among young employees who harness the power of digital technology and engage with the digital ecosystem, to develop solutions for a lasting change in society. Other accolades include the Emerging Social Enterprise 2021 award from TiE Hyderabad, winner of TATA Motor’s TACNet Initiative and Best Indian Social Enterprise Award by Action for India 2019.

# Health and Wellness

Since its founding, DISQ has worked with 7 cohorts with more than 600 innovators, 35% of who are female. These innovators hail from 22 states and from over 180 colleges across India.

In FY 2023, DISQ encouraged innovation using digital technologies to address the social challenges drawn from the voice of citizens, domain experts, local administration, and the government and has nurtured over 65 changemakers. These are purpose-led innovations in agri-tech, assistive-tech, health and wellness tech and sustainability tech across India.

Holistic well-being programs offered within TCS promote healthier lifestyles by offering work-life balance and by looking into emotional health. When people are in a state of well-being at work, they are motivated to realize their potential, take on responsibility, build positive workplace relationships, manage their time better, make meaningful contributions, and be productive and creative.

TCS actively promotes healthy and active lifestyles with employee engagement programs like Fit4Life, Purpose4Life and SafetyFirst which help create awareness about health and fitness and enables its employees to engage with the community for a positive impact.

DISQ offers innovators extensive mentoring, access to ecosystems specific to their challenges, and a seed fund for investment in creating their innovation and start-up, along with physical infrastructure that fosters out-of-the-box thinking and a supportive ecosystem with domain partners for validation.

Modeled around DISQ, Petronas and TCS in Malaysia, recently launched SEEd.Lab- a one-of-its-kind social enterprise innovation hub which targets youth unemployment. It promotes self-sustaining enterprises that forge solutions to the challenges faced in their communities by leveraging technology and innovation.

# DISQ Case Study

Vesatogo Innovations is a Nashik-based agritech startup conceptualized in 2019 by DISQ Changemakers who were passionate about reimagining the agrarian landscape. TCS plays a crucial role in providing IT solutions for various non-conformities raised by NABH Assessors. It works closely with the Bone Marrow Transplant department to provide IT related support for its FACT accreditation and has provided IT support to TMC for their Pharmacy migration to ‘TATA 1mg.’

TCS’ transformations at Tata Medical Center, Kolkata and Cancer Institute, Chennai facilitated more than 117,600 new patient consultations in FY 2023.

TCS partnered with TMC, Kolkata to successfully establish Tata Translational Cancer Research Centre (TTCRC). The partnership was established to create an interactive environment for clinicians, scientists, and industry to collaborate and translate data driven and discovery-based science for improvements in patient care. It focuses on personalizing therapies, decreasing the cost of treatment, and developing innovative care delivery models for cancer patients in India.

Their solution, conceptualized and designed at TCS’ Digital Impact Square (DISQ), provides mobile and web-based seed to-plate supply chain management tools to reduce operating costs for farmer producer organizations and agribusinesses, and enable small farmers to have better market linkages. It was awarded the National Startup Award 2021 in the Rural Impact category and was amongst the selected 175 startups across the country to interact with the Honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

HOPE - Hours of Purpose by Employees

TCS’ growing, highly skilled and diverse workforce serves as champions to build organic connects with the community while accelerating social impact. Opportunities for employees to volunteer time include skills-based volunteering, pro bono support to community-based organization and social cause leadership. TCS community investments have been actualized, in a large part, by its large employee base who generously volunteer their time, skills and expertise as last-mile connectors, addressing the 17 UN SDGs, ranging from planting saplings and trees, making and distributing newspaper bags, raising mental health awareness and educating children in schools, to name a few. TCSers also contribute to the Tata group’s volunteering initiatives twice a year, such as Tata Volunteering Week and Pro-Engage (long-term pro bono volunteering).

All the volunteering initiatives are monitored and driven by ‘Purpose Councils’ which consists of leaders from regions and business units. Omnichannel campaigns have also been launched at unit, branch and account level business groups to raise awareness, drive efforts, generate feedback and collect ideas. This has been supported by corporate-led communication and marketing events which have helped realize the initiative.

In FY 2023, TCS launched the civic movement #millionhoursofpurpose, a collaborative effort by TCSers to volunteer a million hours of purpose in a quarter which celebrates a positive impact for the people, by the people. The initiative encourages employees to support in different project themes and recognize star volunteers, events, volunteer stories and journeys. TCSers far exceeded the pledge of a #millionhoursofpurpose, by volunteering over 2 million hours in Q4.

When you find your why, you don’t hit snooze anymore! I take pride in being a mouthpiece for the voiceless. I strive to ensure everyone at my office is aware of every volunteering opportunity, and I participate in all of them.

HOPE is of great importance as it encourages associates to discover their purpose and cater to the needs of the community. Encouraging a team of + associates towards contributing to the HOPE campaign was an amazing experience.

It was wonderful to see people take up volunteering activities like tree planting and coaching underprivileged students. As a community, with our joint efforts, I believe we can multiply our impact through HOPE.

# Volunteering for Youth Employment Program (YEP)

Rahul Pathak’s journey of volunteering started six years back, with him travelling to Osmanabad around 280 kms from Pune over weekends to teach the students of Terna College of Engineering.

function serves as an accelerator for social good and as a catalyst between purpose-driven organizations. Several studies and surveys have revealed that consumers are loyal towards organizations that are “purpose driven” and have an objective of “giving back to the community.”

Business with Purpose provides opportunities for business leaders from customers’ organizations to meet their commitment to the society. This is enabled with strategic and

Rahul did face challenges initially teaching in virtual mode, but he overcame it by using effective online teaching skills like polling, breakout rooms etc. He felt because of the virtual mode now he can contribute to engineering colleges outside Maharashtra. In his sessions, Rahul always gives practical examples which the students can relate to, and understand better. He also helps these youth in developing confidence so that they can succeed in all aspects of their lives.

Rahul quotes “I felt quite proud as a teacher when my students secured their dream jobs. My life suddenly seemed to have a meaning and purpose. Giving is the greatest feeling in the world, and seeing my students achieve their goals and flourish in their jobs brings me enormous joy. Continue to contribute to this worthy cause; these youngsters desperately need mentoring from TCS YEP Faculties.”

# TCS Volunteers Deploy with Red Cross, NA

In Oct’22, five TCSers deployed to Florida with the Red Cross to volunteer in areas impacted by Hurricane Ian, the deadliest hurricane to have hit Florida in decades. Their reasons were different and reflected their life experiences. Some signed on to a 9-day deployment to give back to the community the help they had received during a natural disaster. Others had served previously with the military or a service organization and wanted to use that experience to help.

This helps those organizations extend their support to more local and global beneficiaries, demonstrating the force multiplier effect that technology can play. Millions of dollars of ‘social value’ have been generated by this program since its inception.

# International Medical Corps (IMC) Case Study

A first responder, International Medical Corps (IMC) provides emergency relief to those struck by conflict, disaster, and disease. IMC approached TCS seeking help in digitizing their vendor pre-qualification platform, a critical component of the procurement workflow. IMC does not procure supplies from a vendor who has not completed the qualification process or whose qualification has lapsed, which can lead to a shortage of critical supplies that IMC beneficiaries depend on.

During their deployment, Aria Rahimi, Lewis Hunt, Charu Mehndiratta, Patty Sanchez, and Niki Shah packed food supplies and distributed them to affected communities on Pine Island and other areas in Lee County. They assisted in identifying and addressing local needs with respect to shelter, food, health and spiritual services.

The process was arduous and complicated with a high margin for potential error. After in-depth research seeking to gain a comprehensive understanding of IMC’s vendor pre-qualification system, TCS redesigned and enhanced the existing system by placing it in a digital platform that is more transparent and accessible for IMC’s team. The system offers IMC a structured workflow for maintaining vendor information, tracking critical vendor qualification status, and ensuring the organization has on-demand and concurrent access to vital information throughout the vendor database.

# Business with Purpose

Business with Purpose is a distinctive framework that enables ‘Purpose Partnerships’ with like-minded organizations to advance access, equity and inclusion around the world.

,nte˥rate˟ ƪnnXal Report 202223 Corporate Social Responsibility | 142


Last year, the organization responded directly to the needs of more than 18 million people in 30 countries on five continents, including more than 1 million people in the United States. “Being a first responder organization means our work is fast-paced and vital to vulnerable populations. Working with TCS enabled us to increase the efficiency of our vendor prequalification process, which is critical to our operations,” said Salma Abdelfattah, Pharmaceutical Services Coordinator, International Medical Corps.

The company leverages its industry and social responsibility expertise to build the capacity of educators and to nurture students from marginalized communities globally. This is achieved through partnerships with the right institutions for disseminating TCS’ programs such as IMF and goIT which are in line with nationwide goals.

The partnership with Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan enabled state-wide deployment of these programs throughout India. For example, in Gujarat training of 75,000 middle school teachers from 14,486 schools is expected to benefit 1.8 million students in grades 6, 7 and 8 over a period of 3 years.

# Digital Empowers

TCS’s Digital Empowers is a thought leadership initiative that raises awareness on how digital tools and innovative technology catalyze social impact. The program focuses on convening experts from technology, business, non-profit, public policy, and academia to ideate, collaborate, and create digitally driven solutions towards challenges of social impact. TCS has grown the Digital Empowers community by more than 500 individuals and the website provides up-to-date information for forums, events and insight reports.

# Major partnerships in FY 2023 include:

- Partnership with the state government departments of social welfare for deployment in residential and day-boarding schools they run. For example, partnerships with UP Samaj Kalyan department (105 schools) and the Andhra Pradesh social welfare department (189 schools).
- Partnership with the education department to integrate 21st-century skills into textbooks and the curriculum.
- For FY 2023, TCS Digital Empowers, North America partnered with Chief Executives for Corporate Purpose (CECP) and PYXERA Global to host an eight-part virtual forum series on food security, the future of work, mental health equity, the digital divide and disaster response. The final forum took place in February 2023, and the seven forums in 2022 culminated in an annual 2023 Summit.

The pilot of Digital Empowers Collaborative launched this year, facilitated a 20-person collaboration from across sectors to explore how digital can empower a more equitable and inclusive future of work. The group hosted four expert speakers and spent more than 150 professional hours to develop three partnership solution concepts to improve the future of work:

- Membership of bodies such as the Computer Science Teachers Association.
- Partnership with Tata group companies such as Tata Steel Foundation which brought computational thinking to 5,000 students from schools in tribal areas.

# 1) Digital Upskilling

A path to bring down the digital divide for rural residents over the age of 50 for better participation in the digital economy.

# 2) Generational Workforce Knowledge Retention

A digital wiki concept developed to support institutional knowledge retention and cross-pollination of senior knowledge to juniors enabling the retention of knowledge from a growing retiring population amidst the high turnover rate experienced by many organizations.

# 3) Equitable Foundation for the Workforce of Tomorrow

An employee resource group idea designed for a large-scale group with high accountability and impact to create a safer and more transparent workplace.

# Purpose Partnerships

TCS’ CSR education programs focus on developing 21st century skills among the underrepresented and socio-economically weaker sections of society. The National Education Policy 2020 also recommends that skills like computational thinking, design thinking, problem-solving, and critical thinking should be included in the curriculum.

- Full Stack Web Development, Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence, UX design, Project Management, IT Support, IT Automation, Digital Marketing, Data Analytics and domain – hospitality.

# Disaster Relief Efforts

Ukraine War

TCS extended its support to the humanitarian tragedy that unfolded in Ukraine through financial contribution of €1 million.




to UNICEF, CARE, and the European Food Banks Federation (FEBA). A matched giving campaign for the company’s employees and networks was launched to build on the initiatives of its employees across Europe. TCS employees in the region collectively donated €130,000 which was matched by TCS, totalling €260,000. This resulted in a final contribution of €1,260,000.

The company partnered with non-profit partners like UNICEF, CARE and the European Food Banks Federation to address critical needs such as access to safe drinking water and sanitation services, benefiting over 20 million people. Furthermore, short-term relief support such as shelter, food and health and long-term resilience care (child protection, psycho-social protection and temporary learning spaces) were provided.

# TCS participated in the ‘Sunflower Project’

an initiative from the ‘Tent Partnership for Refugees’. It provided mentoring, training and upskilling to displaced Ukrainians to support their economic integration in the host countries. It also organized in-kind donations of more than 300 laptops to schools that support refugees in Europe.

# TCS launched several mentorship programs in Europe

to help refugees enter the labor market. This involves capacity building to strengthen the capabilities of NGOs through participation in TCS’s Global Community Innovation program and exploration of the upskilling needs of refugees with TCS Education Business Units. TCS worked with another non-profit organization in Finland that trains refugees from Ukraine as part of a program.

# Assam Floods

During the Assam flood, TCS aided the relief activities through its branch in Kolkata. Flood responses were carried out in the severely affected areas of Cachar District, including the Kalain, Katigorah, Borkhola and Salchapra blocks. Over 1,200 household beneficiaries were identified after a thorough door-to-door survey and approximately 850 shelter kits and 800 housing kits were distributed to them. The volunteering efforts included surveying each village to identify beneficiary households, identifying and finalizing potential distribution sites, and meeting stakeholders such as the District Disaster Management Authority, and local security forces to coordinate efforts. TCS also rendered additional support through volunteer mapping, coupon generation and distribution at the village level, as well as relief distribution.

# Turkey / Syria Earthquake

The earthquake in Turkey and Syria caused massive destruction and loss of lives. TCSers were quick to respond and extended their support to the humanitarian tragedy. Employees volunteered with local NGOs and launched donation drives across TCS’ offices in Europe to collect winter clothes, blankets, food, and hygiene supplies for the affected population.

Governance, leadership and oversight

7. Statement by director responsible for the business responsibility report, highlighting ESG related challenges, targets and achievements (listed entity has flexibility regarding the placement of this disclosure)32

N G Subramaniam, COO &#x26; Executive Director, TCS33: “Our net zero goal underlines our renewed commitment to environmental stewardship. To curb emissions and limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels, all organizations will have to reimagine existing business models and aim for sustainable growth. We are in a unique position to combine our purpose-driven world view with digital innovation to not only drive our own sustainability, but also partner with customers, civil society and governments to lead and shape solutions for a sustainable future.”

At the core of TCS’ strategy to reduce its carbon footprint is increased use of renewable sources of energy, and improved energy efficiency. The company’s strategy for the latter includes addition of more green buildings to the company’s real estate portfolio, reduction of IT system power usage, and the use of TCS Clever Energy™, which leverages IoT, machine learning and AI to optimize energy consumption across campuses. TCS’ Vision 25x25 is a strategic lever that delinks TCS’ business growth from campus expansion and brings down emissions related to employee commutes and business travel. Environmental targets and achievements are part of Natural Capital section, which is a part of Integrated Annual Report.

Stakeholder interactions result in the identification of a broad funnel of issues important to each of the constituencies. The Company’s Sustainability Council uses discussions with internal and external stakeholders, as well as its own judgment, to prioritize and arrive at a list of material topics with significant economic, environmental, or social impacts on TCS’ business, reputation, and operations. The TCS management shares feedback with the Board on these issues.
2. Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.

Notes:

- At TCS, remuneration is the same for men and women working full-time, in the same grade, in the same role, and at the same location, and with the same level of experience⁷⁰. Where relevant, the company publishes the raw mean and median pay differences between genders (not normalized for part-timers or grade and role differences) on its own website as well as on public sites. Gaps in median salary between genders at middle and senior levels is due to a higher proportion of women at the junior ends of each cohort. TCS’ focused diversity and inclusion programs are expected to narrow this gap over time.

# 7. Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.

Yes. TCS had set a target to reduce its absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 70% by 2025 and become net zero by 2030. The first part was achieved in FY 2023 through a combination of green infrastructure, green IT, energy efficiency and renewable energy.

# Commitment to Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)

In June 2022, TCS has responded to SBTi’s urgent call for corporate climate action by committing to align with 1.5°C and net-zero through the Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign. This is published on SBTi website and can be viewed at Companies taking action- Science Based Targets. TCS is working on the next steps to developing company targets for validation by SBTi.

# Green Infrastructure and IT enabled operational efficiency:

All new campuses owned by TCS are designed according to green building standards for energy and resource efficiency. They have roof-top solar photovoltaic installations to reduce the carbon footprint. Currently, 36 TCS offices, with over 23.68 million sq. ft of office area, are certified green buildings by Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). These make up over 64.6% of TCS’ total real estate portfolio in India.

During the year, several initiatives were aligned to achieve the carbon targets which included those in building and IT infrastructure. Initiatives in building infrastructure included energy efficiencies in HVAC systems, Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS), LEDs, motors, and chillers.

- HVAC system upgradation included deployment of energy efficient fans for Air handling units (AHUs), Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) systems for 24X7 on variable load, oilless centrifugal chillers like magnetic or ceramic bearing chillers and chiller plant manager.
- Energy efficient UPS included Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT) based UPS with high efficiency and modular UPS.
- Other energy efficiency initiatives included LED lighting with advanced controls, EFF1/IE3 rated high efficiency motors, 11KV power distribution from sub-station to different buildings, use of 11 kV centrifugal chillers and elevators with energy efficient and gearless motors.

81 There are some inclusions and modifications in estimating carbon emissions during FY 2023 when compared to FY 2022. Scope 2 emissions: The emission factors for the grid electricity across various geographies have been taken primarily from IEA v5-IEA 2022 (12/2022) database except for US, Canada, Australia, and India where emission factors are available from regional sources. For India geography, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), user guide 18.0, Dec 2022 emission factor of 0.715 tCO2/ MWh (carbon emission factor of grid electricity, including RE) has been considered for estimating the carbon emissions from procured electricity in FY 2023. Over the years CEA has been publishing the weighted average carbon emission factor (conventional) of the grid which was being used by TCS for Scope 2 emissions until FY 2022 as emission factors (including RE) was not available earlier. However, in Dec 2022, CEA published the carbon emission factor of grid electricity (including RE) for the first time for years 2013-14 to 2021-22. As TCS procures electricity from the India grid, which is mix of conventional and renewable energy, the emission factor of 0.715 tCO2/ MWh is considered more appropriate.

82 Corrected Scope 1 emissions data for FY 2022 due to minor changes in fuel consumption data.

Green IT:
Initiatives in green IT focused on data center and IT device consolidation and optimization to reduce the carbon footprint. The areas covered under green IT initiatives include IT energy optimization in data center and equipment rooms. In addition, green attributes are considered in every asset procurement. TCS’ data centers have a weighted average PUE of 1.66.

TCS’ IoT-based Real-time Energy Management System (TCS Clever Energy™)84 initiative involves real time monitoring to optimize the operational energy efficiency across all offices. The smart, scalable, analytics driven IoT solution uses TCS Connected Universe Platform (TCUP) IoT platform, which forms the backbone enabling visualization of data acquired from various locations and facilities’ energy meters and sensors.

# Renewable Energy:

The roof top solar photo voltaic installations this year remained at 10.2 MWp contributing to 3.4% of total electricity use in FY 2023. The company increased its renewable energy procurement through a) switch over to green tariffs for its operations in Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Indore, Bhubaneshwar, Pune, and Thane, b) 1 MWp open access power purchase agreements (PPA) signed at Siruseri (as an extension to the previous 12 MWp PPA). The renewable energy procurement has resulted in an increase in renewable energy use to 55.2% of total energy use.

# Carbon Neutrality:

The company became carbon neutral across Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in North America, UK and Ireland (except Diligenta), Europe, Asia Pacific (excluding Japan), Latin America, and Middle East &#x26; Africa in FY 2023.

93 GRI 305-3, GRI 305-4; There are some inclusions and modifications in estimating scope 3 carbon emissions during FY 2023 when compared to FY 2022.

94 Scope 3 emissions:

- Category 1 &#x26; 2: Emission factors (spend based) for purchased and capital goods are taken from the latest available US EPA (Supply Chain GHG Emission Factors for US Commodities and Industries v1.1.1) information for computer equipment, electrical equipment, office equipment, vehicles, and furniture items. Until FY 2022, TCS used the DEFRA 2012, spend based emission factors, which are outdated. In view of adopting updated emission factors, there was a reduction in category 1 by 89% and category 2 by 82%.
- Category 3: The well to tank (WTT) emissions from the fuel used in stationary and mobile combustion such as diesel in DG sets and owned vehicles, LPG or PNG in cafeteria, natural gas for space heating/ cooling, fuel used in hired vehicles (cabs/ buses) are included in this category in FY 2023. Earlier in FY 2022, only WTT of electricity procured was considered. The increase in scope of reporting contributes to 3.5% of the total emissions under category 3.
- Category 4: Until FY 2022, TCS had included only emissions from transportation of IT assets considering its relative significance compared to other supplies. In FY 2023, TCS has also included emissions related to non-IT supplies and waste disposal. The supplies include cafeteria/ canteen supplies, water supplies through tankers, housekeeping material and other stationary supplies and disposal of wastes (e-wastes, hazardous wastes, batteries etc.,). Emission factors are taken from DEFRA 2022 for the transport emissions based on vehicle type and weight. The increase in scope of reporting contributes to 31% of the total emissions under category 4.
- Category 5: No change in approach in FY 2023. The emissions are based on disposal mechanisms (e.g., recycling, reuse, landfill) for different categories of waste (plastic, metal, e-waste, batteries, food waste, garden waste etc.,) and have been computed based on emission factors from DEFRA 2022.
- Category 6: In FY 2022, business travel included emissions from air and rail. In FY 2023, business travel emissions also include hotel stays at various geographies during business travel. Relevant emission factors are taken from DEFRA 2022. The increase in scope of reporting contributes to 0.5% of the total emissions under category 6.
- Category 7: In FY 2023, the employee commute related carbon emission includes those from TCS hired vehicles for transport of employees (global), personal employee commute (only India), public employee commute (only India) and work from home (WFH) emissions (global). In pre-pandemic period, TCS had considered and included private and public commute of India employees in carbon emissions, however during FY 2021 and FY 2022, this was insignificant to be included under this category. The occupancy in overseas offices has been minimum during FY 2023 due to majority of the associates working from home and therefore considered insignificant, and not included in the emissions.

# Emergency Preparedness Plans

TCS has Emergency Preparedness Plans (EPP) for disasters such as earthquake, floods, cyclones etc in its internal portal. The plan outlays the responsibilities of action owners, plan description including precautions to be taken, evacuation procedures and post incident action plan which would need to be followed at locations facing the emergency scenario.

Every customer relationship, region (branch), global delivery center and corporate IS function maintains a BCP plan that is updated once in six months or on a need basis. The framework ensures that respective owners consider all contractual/regulatory requirements, scope of services, demographics of operations, interdependencies of services and underlying assets, identifies business impact of loss/interruption or disruption, and determines appropriate continuity strategy for the same. The associated potential risks are identified, assessed and appropriate response is devised to handle respective risks.

# 8. Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity.

No significant adverse impact envisaged from TCS’ value chain.

# 9. Percentage of value chain partners (by value of business done with such partners) that were assessed for environmental impacts.

TCS assesses 100% of its suppliers’ environmental footprint at the time of their respective empanelment. Towards ongoing sustainability assessment, TCS launched its Supplier Sustainability Assessment Platform and initiated on-boarding of its top supply chain partners in FY 2023. Through this platform, TCS plans to support its suppliers with engagement and guidance to help them improve their sustainability performance.

During FY 2023, TCS has also implemented system-enabled database checks and risk profiling of its top 80% suppliers (by spend) across sectors and geographies. Of the top 80% suppliers by spend, 20% suppliers have already completed sustainability assessment for environment criteria.

Consolidated Financial Statements

# Independent Auditor’s Report

To the Members of Tata Consultancy Services Limited

# Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

# Opinion

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited (hereinafter referred to as the "Holding Company") and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as "the Group"), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2023, and the consolidated statement of profit and loss (including other comprehensive income), consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as "the consolidated financial statements").

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 ("Act") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at 31 March 2023, of its consolidated profit and other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the Act, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

# Key Audit Matter(s)

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# Revenue recognition– Fixed price contracts where revenue is recognized using percentage of completion method

See Note 5(a) and Note 12 to consolidated financial statements

The key audit matter

The Group inter alia engages in Fixed-price contracts, wherein, revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion computed as per the input method based on the Group’s estimate of contract costs. We identified revenue recognition of fixed price contracts where the percentage of completion is used as a key audit matter since:

- there is an inherent risk and presumed fraud risk around the accuracy and existence of revenues recognised considering the customised and complex nature of these contracts and significant inputs of IT systems;

How the matter was addressed in our audit

Our audit procedures included the following:

- Obtained an understanding of the systems, processes and controls implemented by the Group for recording and computing revenue and the associated contract assets, unearned and deferred revenue balances.
- Involvement of our Information technology (‘IT’) specialists, as required:

Consolidated Financial Statements | 183


# The key audit matter

# How the matter was addressed in our audit

- Application of revenue recognition accounting standard (Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts with customers) is complex and involves a number of key judgments and estimates in mainly identifying performance obligations, related transaction price and estimating the future cost-to-completion of these contracts, which is used to determine the percentage of completion of the relevant performance obligation;
- These contracts may involve onerous obligations which requires critical assessment of foreseeable losses to be made by the Group; and
- At year-end, significant amount of work in progress (Contract assets), related to these contracts are recognised on the balance sheet.

# On selected specific and statistical samples of contracts, we tested that the revenue recognized is in accordance with the revenue recognition accounting standard including –

- Evaluated the identification of performance obligations and the ascribed transaction price;
- For testing the Group’s computation of the estimation of contract costs and onerous obligations, if any. We:

# Other Information

The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Holding Company’s Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and auditor’s reports thereon. The Holding Company’s Annual Report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

# Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial statements in term of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated state, in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of each company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; the selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Management and Board of Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Management and Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for assessing





the ability of each company to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of each company.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of consolidated financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the appropriateness of this assumption.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.

Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited for the year ended 31 March 2023

# Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid consolidated financial statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013

(Referred to in paragraph 2A(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date)

# Opinion

In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited (hereinafter referred to as “the Holding Company”) as of and for the year ended 31 March 2023, we have audited the internal financial controls with reference to the financial statements of the Holding Company and such companies incorporated in India under the Companies Act, 2013, which are its subsidiary companies, as of that date.

In our opinion, the Holding Company and such companies incorporated in India which are its subsidiary companies, have, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and such internal financial controls were operating effectively as at 31 March 2023, based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by such companies considering the essential components of such internal controls stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “Guidance Note”).

# Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls

The respective Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on the criteria established by the respective company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.

# Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements.

# Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements

A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

# Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

# 1) Corporate information

Tata Consultancy Services Limited (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively together with employee welfare trusts referred to as “the Group”) provide IT services, consulting and business solutions and have been partnering with many of the world’s largest businesses in their transformation journeys. The Group offers a consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions. This is delivered through its unique Location-Independent Agile delivery model recognised as a benchmark of excellence in software development.

The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in India. The address of its corporate office is TCS House, Raveline Street, Fort, Mumbai- 400001. As at March 31, 2023, Tata Sons Private Limited, the holding company owned 72.27% of the Company’s equity share capital.

The Board of Directors approved the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 and authorised for issue on April 12, 2023.

# 2) Statement of compliance

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standard (referred to as “Ind AS”) prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to time.

The Company establishes control when; it has power over the entity, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect the entity’s returns by using its power over relevant activities of the entity.

# 3) Basis of preparation

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured at fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. All assets and liabilities have been classified as current and non-current as per the Group’s normal operating cycle.

Based on the nature of services rendered to customers and time elapsed between deployment of resources and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the consideration for such services rendered, the Group has considered an operating cycle of 12 months. Entities controlled by the Company are consolidated from the date control commences until the date control ceases. The results of subsidiaries acquired, or sold, during the year are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.

The financial statements of the Group companies are consolidated on a line-by-line basis and all inter-company transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.

Changes in the Company’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amount of the Company’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to shareholders of the Company.

The statement of cash flows has been prepared under indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated. The Group considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value to be cash equivalents.

The functional currency of the Company and its Indian subsidiaries is the Indian Rupee (`). The functional currency of foreign subsidiaries is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Foreign currency transactions are recorded at exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet dates and exchange gains and losses arising on settlement and restatement are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not retranslated.

# 5) Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with the recognition and measurement principles of Ind AS requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent liabilities as at the date of consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the periods presented.

The Group uses estimates and judgements based on the relevant rulings in the areas of allocation of revenue, costs, allowances and disallowances which is exercised while determining the provision for income tax. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised. Accordingly, the Group exercises its judgement to reassess the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected.

# (f) Provisions and contingent liabilities

The Group estimates the provisions that have present obligations as a result of past events and it is probable that outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. The Group uses significant judgements to assess contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are recognised when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.

# (g) Employee benefits

The accounting of employee benefit plans in the nature of defined benefit requires the Group to use assumptions. These assumptions have been explained under employee benefits note.

# (h) Leases

The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. Identification of a lease requires significant judgement. The Group uses significant judgement in assessing the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate. The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with both periods covered by an option to extend the lease.

# 6) Recent pronouncements

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On March 31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as below:

# Ind AS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements

The amendments require companies to disclose their material accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies. Accounting policy information, together with other information, is material when it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary users of general purpose financial statements. The Group does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements.

# Ind AS 12 – Income Taxes

The amendments clarify how companies account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations. The amendments narrowed the scope of the recognition exemption in paragraphs 15 and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so that it no longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The Group is evaluating the impact, if any, in its financial statements.

# Ind AS 8 – Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors

The amendments will help entities to distinguish between accounting policies and accounting estimates. The definition of a change in accounting estimates has been replaced with a definition of accounting estimates. Under the new definition, accounting estimates are “monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty”. Entities develop accounting estimates if accounting policies require items in financial profit or loss to be measured in a way that involves measurement uncertainty. The Group does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements.

# 7) Business combinations

The Group accounts for its business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Acquisition related costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the condition for recognition are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.

The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics. Purchase consideration paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Where the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities exceed the cost of acquisition, after reassessing the fair values of the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is recognised as capital reserve.

The interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity of subsidiaries.

Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under common control are accounted at historical cost. The difference between any consideration given and the aggregate historical carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of the acquired entity is recorded in shareholders’ equity.

# 8) Financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured on initial recognition of financial asset or financial liability.

The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired.

# Cash and cash equivalents

The Group considers all highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.

# Financial assets at amortised cost

Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows. The effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce the risk associated with the exposure being hedged is assessed and measured at inception and on an ongoing basis. If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in other equity are immediately reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in the statement of profit and loss.

# Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income

Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and selling financial assets.

The effective portion of change in the fair value of the designated hedging instrument is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading cash flow hedging reserve.

The Group has made an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of equity investments not held for trading in other comprehensive income. The Group separates the intrinsic value and time value of an option and designates as hedging instruments only the change in intrinsic value of the option.

# Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are immediately recognised in statement of profit and loss.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity till that time remains and is recognised in statement of profit and loss when the forecasted transaction ultimately affects profit and loss. Any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss when the hedge becomes ineffective.

# Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

# Equity instruments

An equity instrument is a contract that evidences residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received net of direct issue cost.

# Derivative accounting

# Instruments in hedging relationship

The Group designates certain foreign exchange forward, currency options and futures contracts as hedge instruments in respect of foreign exchange risks. These hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

# Instruments not in hedging relationship

The Group enters into contracts that are effective as hedges from an economic perspective, but they do not qualify for hedge accounting. The change in the fair value of such instrument is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

# Impairment of financial assets (other than at fair value)

The Group assesses at each date of balance sheet whether a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. Ind AS 109 requires expected credit losses to be measured.

Consolidated Financial Statements 2022-23 | 199

through a loss allowance. The Group recognises lifetime expected losses for all contract assets and / or all trade receivables that do not constitute a financing transaction. In determining the allowances for doubtful trade receivables, the Group has used a practical expedient by computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward looking information. The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and allowance rates used in the provision matrix. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-months expected credit losses or at an amount equal to the life time expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition.

Loans include inter-corporate deposits of `6,377 crore, with original maturity period within 36 months. Carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans and trade payables as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, approximate the fair value due to their nature. Carrying amounts of bank deposits, earmarked balances with banks, other financial assets and other financial liabilities which are subsequently measured at amortised cost also approximate the fair value due to their nature in each of the periods presented. Fair value measurement of lease liabilities is not required. Fair value of investments carried at amortised cost is `5,587 crore and `1,672 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

# (j) Fair value hierarchy

The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable and consists of the following three levels:

- Level 1 — Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 — Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3 — Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.

The cost of unquoted investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy approximate their fair value because there is a wide range of possible fair value measurements and the cost represents estimate of fair value within that range.

# (k) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activity

The Group’s revenue is denominated in various foreign currencies. Given the nature of the business, a large portion of the costs are denominated in Indian Rupee. This exposes the Group to currency fluctuations.

The Board of Directors has constituted a Risk Management Committee (RMC) to frame, implement and monitor the risk management plan of the Group which inter-alia covers risks arising out of exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Under the guidance and framework provided by the RMC, the Group uses various derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward, currency options and futures contracts in which the counter party is generally a bank.

# (l) Financial risk management

The Group is exposed primarily to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, which may adversely impact the fair value of its financial instruments. The Group has a risk management policy which covers risks associated with the financial assets and liabilities. The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors. The focus of the risk management committee is to assess the unpredictability of the financial environment and to mitigate potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group.

# Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit, liquidity and other market changes. The Group’s exposure to market risk is primarily on account of foreign currency exchange rate risk.

# • Foreign currency exchange rate risk

The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets / liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective entities. Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Group operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries.

The Group, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange. Further, any movement in the functional currencies of the various operations of the Group against major foreign currencies may impact the Group’s revenue in international business.

The Group evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks. It hedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management policies.

The foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure and a simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the respective functional currencies of Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries.

The following analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures for each of the subsidiaries and Tata Consultancy Services Limited as of the date of balance sheet which could affect the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income and equity. Further the exposure as indicated below is mitigated by some of the derivative contracts entered into by the Group as disclosed in note 8(k).

# The following table sets forth information relating to unhedged foreign currency exposure as at March 31, 2023:

|                           | USD      | EUR   | GBP     | Others |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ----- | ------- | ------ |
| Net financial assets      | 3,869    | 262   | 90      | 2,136  |
| Net financial liabilities | (11,021) | (657) | (1,536) | (270)  |

10% appreciation / depreciation of the respective functional currency of Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries with respect to various foreign currencies would result in increase / decrease in the Group’s profit before taxes by approximately `713 crore for the year ended March 31, 2023.

# The following table sets forth information relating to unhedged foreign currency exposure as at March 31, 2022:

# Interest rate risk

The Group’s investments are primarily in fixed rate interest bearing investments. Hence, the Group is not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.

# Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the contractual terms or obligations. Credit risk encompasses of both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of customers on a continuous basis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit.

Financial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk principally consist of trade receivables, loans, investments, derivative financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and other financial assets. Inter-corporate deposits of `1,016 crore are with a financial institution having a high credit-rating assigned by credit-rating agencies. Bank deposits include an amount of `4,273 crore held with three banks having high credit rating which are individually in excess of 10% or more of the Group’s total bank deposits as at March 31, 2023. None of the other financial instruments of the Group result in material concentration of credit risk.

# Exposure to credit risk

The carrying amount of financial assets and contract assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk was `1,09,258 crore and `1,05,498 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, being the total of the carrying amount of balances with banks, bank deposits, investments, trade receivables, loan, contract assets and other financial assets.

The Group’s exposure to customers is diversified and no single customer contributes to more than 10% of outstanding trade receivables and contract assets as at March 31, 2023 and 2022.

# Geographic concentration of credit risk

Geographic concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is as follows:

|                          |        | As at March 31, 2023 |        | As at March 31, 2022 |       |

Geographical concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is allocated based on the location of the customers.

The allowance for lifetime expected credit loss on trade receivables for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, was `126 crore and `123 crore respectively. The reconciliation of allowance for doubtful trade receivables is as follows:

# 9) Leases

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

# Group as a lessee

The Group accounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from non-lease components of the contract and allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative standalone price of the lease component and the aggregate standalone price of the non-lease components.

The Group recognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease commencement date. The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease.

Incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

The Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably similar characteristics, the Group, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable lease payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Group recognises the amount of the re-measurement of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of profit and loss depending upon the nature of modification. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Group recognises any remaining amount of the re-measurement in statement of profit and loss.

The Group has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

# Group as a lessor

At the inception of the lease the Group classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The Group recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In case of a finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net investment in the lease. When the Group is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.

If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group applies Ind AS 115 Revenue from contracts with customers to allocate the consideration in the contract.

Interest on lease liabilities is `492 crore and `519 crore for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The Group incurred `318 crore and `277 crore for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, towards expenses relating to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.

The total cash outflow for leases is `2,538 crore and `2,228 crore for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, including cash outflow for short term and low value leases.

The Group has lease term extension options that are not reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities. The present value of future cash outflows for such extension periods is `786 crore and `773 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Lease contracts entered by the Group majorly pertain for buildings taken on lease to conduct its business in the ordinary course. The Group does not have any lease restrictions and commitment towards variable rent as per the contract.

# 10) Non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities

# (a) Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost comprising of purchase price and any initial directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use, less accumulated depreciation (other than freehold land) and impairment loss, if any.

Depreciation is provided for property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis so as to expense the cost less residual value over their estimated useful lives based on a technical evaluation. The estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any change in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.

Consolidated Financial Statements 2022-23 | 216

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements

# The estimated useful lives are as mentioned below:

| Type of asset            | Useful lives |
| ------------------------ | ------------ |
| Buildings                | 20 years     |
| Leasehold improvements   | Lease term   |
| Plant and equipment      | 10 years     |
| Computer equipment       | 4 years      |
| Vehicles                 | 4 years      |
| Office equipment         | 2-5 years    |
| Electrical installations | 4-10 years   |
| Furniture and fixtures   | 5 years      |

Depreciation is not recorded on capital work-in-progress until construction and installation are complete and the asset is ready for its intended use.

Property, plant and equipment with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

# (b) Goodwill

Goodwill represents the cost of acquired business as established at the date of acquisition of the business in excess of the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount.

CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is indication for impairment. The financial projections basis which the future cash flows have been estimated consider economic uncertainties, reassessment of the discount rates, revisiting the growth rates factored while arriving at terminal value and subjecting these variables to sensitivity analysis. If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.

Goodwill consists of the following:

|                                      | As at March 31, 2023 | As at March 31, 2022 |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Balance at the beginning of the year | 1,787                | 1,798                |
| Translation exchange difference      | 71                   | (11)                 |
| Balance at the end of the year       | 1,858                | 1,787                |

Goodwill of `685 crore and `646 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, has been allocated to the TCS business in France. The estimated value-in-use of this CGU is based on the future cash flows using a 1.50% annual growth rate for periods subsequent to the forecast period of 5 years and discount rate of 9.30%. An analysis of the sensitivity of the computation to a change in key parameters (operating margin, discount rates and long term average growth rate), based on reasonable assumptions, did not identify any probable scenario in which the recoverable amount of the CGU would decrease below its carrying amount.

The remaining amount of goodwill of `1,173 crore and `1,141 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, (relating to different CGUs individually immaterial) has been evaluated based on the cash flow forecasts of the related CGUs and the recoverable amounts of these CGUs exceeded their carrying amounts.

# (c) Other intangible assets

Intangible assets purchased including acquired in business combination, are measured at cost as at the date of acquisition, as applicable, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment, if any.

Intangible assets consist of rights under licensing agreement and software licences and customer-related intangibles.

Following table summarises the nature of intangibles and their estimated useful lives:

| Type of asset                                          | Useful lives                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Rights under licensing agreement and software licences | Lower of licence period and 2-5 years |
| Customer-related intangibles                           | 3 years                               |

Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of its economic useful life. Intangible assets with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

Intangible assets consist of the following:

|                                               | Rights under licensing agreement and software licences | Customer-related intangibles | Total   |

# 12) Revenue recognition

The Group earns revenue primarily from providing IT services, consulting and business solutions. The Group offers a consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions.

Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Group expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.

- Revenue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on output basis measured by units delivered, efforts expended, number of transactions processed, etc.
- Revenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts where the Group is standing ready to provide services is recognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight lined over the period of performance.
- In respect of other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognised using percentage-of-completion method (‘POC method’) of accounting with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of the performance obligation. The contract costs used in computing the revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.
- Revenue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and manufactured systems and third party software is recognised upfront at the point in time when the system / software is delivered to the customer. In cases where implementation and / or customisation services rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services and software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognised over time on a POC method.
- Revenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer.
- The solutions offered by the Group may include supply of third-party equipment or software. In such cases, revenue for supply of such third party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether the Group is acting as the principal or as an agent of the customer. The Group recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration when it is acting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.

Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue also excludes taxes collected from customers.

The Group’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. The Group assesses the products / services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract.

Consolidated Financial Statements 2022-23 | 224

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements

Identification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables.

Judgement is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation. The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable consideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant financing component. Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for a distinct product or service from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Group allocates the elements of variable considerations to all the performance obligations of the contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct performance obligations.

The Group exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period of time. The Group considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered or who controls the asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of such product or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.

Contract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for capitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The assessment of this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.

Contract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified as unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms.

Unearned and deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.

The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance based payments and / or milestone based progress payments. Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.

In accordance with Ind AS 37, the Group recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.

Contracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Group reviews modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In the event transaction price is revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.

The Group disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature of services, industry verticals and geography.

# Revenue disaggregation by nature of services is as follows:

| Year ended                              | Year ended     |          |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| March 31, 2023                          | March 31, 2022 |          |
| Consultancy services                    | 2,23,332       | 1,90,289 |
| Sale of equipment and software licences | 2,126          | 1,465    |
|                                         | 2,25,458       | 1,91,754 |

Revenue disaggregation by industry vertical and geography has been included in segment information (Refer note 19).

While disclosing the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognise those revenues, the Group has applied the practical expedient in Ind AS 115. Accordingly, the Group has not disclosed the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations which pertain to contracts where revenue recognised corresponds to the value transferred to customer typically involving time and material, outcome based and event based contracts.

Consolidated Financial Statements 2022-23 | 225

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements

Unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations are subject to variability due to several factors such as terminations, changes in scope of contracts, periodic revalidations of the estimates, economic factors (changes in currency rates, tax laws etc). The aggregate value of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations is `1,38,231 crore out of which 53.17% is expected to be recognised as revenue in the next year and the balance thereafter. No consideration from contracts with customers is excluded from the amount mentioned above.

# 14) Employee benefits

# Defined benefit plans

For defined benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Past service cost, both vested and unvested, is recognised as an expense at the earlier of (a) when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs; and (b) when the entity recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits.

The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.

The Group provides benefits such as gratuity, pension and provident fund (Company managed fund) to its employees which are treated as defined benefit plans.

# Short-term employee benefits

All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short-term employee benefits. Benefits such as salaries, wages etc. and the expected cost of ex-gratia are recognised in the period in which the employee renders the related service. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid when there is a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

# Compensated absences

Compensated absences which are expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related services are recognised as undiscounted liability at the balance sheet date. Compensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related services are recognised as an actuarially determined liability at the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date using the Projected Unit Credit Method.

# Gratuity and pension

In accordance with Indian law, Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries in India operate a scheme of gratuity which is a defined benefit plan.

Vesting occurs upon completion of five continuous years of service. The Company manages the plan through a trust. Trustees administer contributions made to the trust. Certain overseas subsidiaries of the Company also provide for retirement benefit pension plans in accordance with the local laws.

Future mortality assumptions are taken based on the published statistics by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India.

The expected benefits are based on the same assumptions as are used to measure Group’s defined benefit plan obligations as at March 31, 2023. The Group is expected to contribute `55 crore to defined benefit plan obligations funds for the year ending March 31, 2024 comprising domestic component of `8 crore and foreign component of `47 crore.

The significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligations are discount rate and expected salary increase. The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.

If the discount rate increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows:

|                   | As at March 31, 2023 |   | As at March 31, 2022 |   |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | - | -------------------- | - |
| Increase of 0.50% | (265)                |   | (372)                |   |
| Decrease of 0.50% | 290                  |   | 422                  |   |

If the expected salary growth increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows:

|                   | As at March 31, 2023 |   | As at March 31, 2022 |   |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | - | -------------------- | - |

The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligations as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.

Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligations has been calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the balance sheet.

Each year an Asset-Liability matching study is performed in which the consequences of the strategic investment policies are analysed in terms of risk and return profiles. Investment and contribution policies are integrated within this study.

# The defined benefit obligations shall mature after year ended March 31, 2023 as follows:

| Year ending March 31, | Defined benefit obligations |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 2024                  | 755                         |

# Provident fund

In accordance with Indian law, all eligible employees of Tata Consultancy Services Limited in India are entitled to receive benefits under the provident fund plan in which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to a trust set up by the Company to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees. This plan is a defined benefit plan as the Company is obligated to provide its members a rate of return which should, at the minimum, meet the interest rate declared by Government administered provident fund. A part of the Company’s contribution is transferred to Government administered pension fund. The contributions made by the Company and the shortfall of interest, if any, are recognised as an expense in profit and loss under employee benefit expenses. In accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund liabilities on the basis of guidance issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions as mentioned below, there is no deficiency in the interest cost as the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than the expected amount to be credited to the individual members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of Government administered provident fund.

All eligible employees of Indian subsidiaries of the Company are entitled to receive benefits under the provident fund plan in which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to the Government administered provident fund plan. A part of the company’s contribution is transferred to Government administered pension fund. This plan is a defined contribution plan as the obligation of the employer is limited to the monthly contributions made to the fund. The contributions made to the fund are recognised as an expense in profit and loss under employee benefit expenses.

# 17) Income taxes

Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the year. Current and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

# Current income taxes

The current income tax expense includes income taxes payable by the Company and its subsidiaries in India and overseas. The current tax payable by the Company and its subsidiaries in India is Indian income tax payable after taking credit for tax relief available for export operations in Special Economic Zones (SEZs). Current income tax payable by overseas branches of the Company is computed in accordance with the tax laws applicable in the jurisdiction in which the respective branch operates. The taxes paid are generally available for set off against the Indian income tax liability of the Company’s worldwide income. The current income tax expense for overseas subsidiaries has been computed based on the tax laws applicable to each subsidiary in the respective jurisdiction in which it operates. Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax paid and income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying unit intends to settle the asset and liability on a net basis.

# Deferred income taxes

Deferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount, except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements

The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.

Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be received or settled.

For operations carried out in SEZs, deferred tax assets or liabilities, if any, have been established for the tax consequences of those temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases that reverse after the tax holiday ends.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the relevant entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Deferred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, to the extent it would be available for set off against future current income tax liability. Accordingly, MAT is recognised as deferred tax asset in the balance sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will be realised.

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements

Unrecognised deferred tax assets relate primarily to business losses and tax credit entitlements which do not qualify for recognition as per the applicable accounting standards. These unexpired business losses will expire based on the year of origination as follows:

| March 31, | Unabsorbed business losses |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| 2028      | (\` crore)                 |
|           | 35                         |

Under the Income-tax Act, 1961, Tata Consultancy Services Limited is liable to pay Minimum Alternate Tax in the tax holiday period. MAT paid can be carried forward for a period of 15 years and can be set off against the future tax liabilities. MAT is recognised as a deferred tax asset only when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will be realised.

Deferred tax liability on temporary differences of `7,180 crore as at March 31, 2023, associated with investments in subsidiaries, has not been recognised, as it is the intention of Tata Consultancy Services Limited to reinvest the earnings of these subsidiaries for the foreseeable future.

# Direct tax contingencies

The Company and its subsidiaries have ongoing disputes with income tax authorities in India and in some of the other jurisdictions where they operate. The disputes relate to tax treatment of certain expenses claimed as deduction, computation or eligibility of tax incentives and allowances and characterisation of fees for services received. The Company and its subsidiaries have recognised contingent liability in respect of tax demands received from direct tax authorities in India and other jurisdictions of `1,542 crore and `1,652 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These demand orders are being contested by the Company and its subsidiaries based on the management evaluation and advise of tax consultants. In respect of tax contingencies of `318 crore and `318 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, not included above, the Company is entitled to an indemnification from the seller of TCS e-Serve Limited.

The Group periodically receives notices and inquiries from income tax authorities related to the Group’s operations in the jurisdictions it operates in. The Group has evaluated these notices and inquiries and has concluded that any consequent income tax claims or demands by the income tax authorities will not succeed on ultimate resolution.

The number of years that are subject to tax assessments varies depending on tax jurisdiction. The major tax jurisdictions of Tata Consultancy Services Limited include India, United States of America and United Kingdom. In India, tax filings from fiscal 2018 are generally subject to examination by the tax authorities. In United States of America, the federal statute of limitation applies to fiscals 2017 and earlier and applicable state statutes of limitation vary by state. In United Kingdom, the statute of limitation generally applies to fiscal 2018 and earlier.

# 19) Segment information

Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements

The Group has identified business segments (‘industry vertical’) as reportable segments. The business segments comprise:

1. Banking, Financial Services and Insurance
2. Manufacturing
3. Retail and Consumer Business
4. Communication, Media and Technology
5. Life Sciences and Healthcare
6. Others such as Energy, Resources and Utilities, e-Governance and Products.

Revenue and expenses directly attributable to segments are reported under each reportable segment. Expenses which are not directly identifiable to each reporting segment have been allocated since associated revenue of the segment or manpower efforts. All other expenses which are not attributable or allocable to segments have been disclosed as unallocable expenses.

The assets and liabilities of the Group are used interchangeably amongst segments. Allocation of such assets and liabilities is not practicable and any forced allocation would not result in any meaningful segregation. Hence assets and liabilities have not been identified to any of the reportable segments.

# Summarised segment information for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, is as follows:

# • Indirect tax matters

The Company and its subsidiaries have ongoing disputes with tax authorities mainly relating to treatment of characterisation and classification of certain items. The Company and its subsidiaries have demands amounting to `568 crore and `568 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, from various indirect tax authorities which are being contested by the Company and its subsidiaries based on the management evaluation and advice of tax consultants.

# • Other claims

Claims aggregating `277 crore and `291 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, against the Group have not been acknowledged as debts.

In addition to above, in October 2014, Epic Systems Corporation (referred to as Epic) filed a legal claim against the Company in the Court of Western District Madison, Wisconsin alleging unauthorised access to and download of their confidential information and use thereof in the development of the Company’s product MedMantra.

In April 2016, the Company received an unfavourable jury verdict awarding damages of `7,730 crore (US $940 million) to Epic which was thereafter reduced by the Trial Court to `3,454 crore (US $420 million). Pursuant to reaffirmation of the District Court Order in March 2019, the Company filed an appeal in the Appeals Court to fully set aside the Order. Epic also filed a cross appeal challenging the reduction by the District Court judge of `822 crore (US $100 million) award and `1,645 crore (US $200 million) in punitive damages.

On August 20, 2020, the Appeals Court (a) vacated the award of `2,303 crore (US $280 million) in punitive damages considering the award to be constitutionally excessive and remanded the case back to District Court with instructions to reassess and reduce the punitive damages award to at most `1,151 crore (US $140 million), (b) affirmed the District Court’s decision vacating the jury’s award of `822 crore (US $100 million) in compensatory damages for alleged use of “other confidential information” by the Company, and, (c) affirmed the District Court’s decision upholding the jury’s award of `1,151 crore (US $140 million) in compensatory damages for use of the comparative analysis by the Company. Considering all the facts and various legal precedence, on a conservative and prudent basis, the Company provided `1,218 crore (US $165 million) towards this legal claim in its statement of profit and loss for three month period ended September 30, 2020. This was presented as an “exceptional item” in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. On April 8, 2021, Epic approached the Supreme Court seeking review of the Order of the Appeals Court which was denied by the Supreme Court on March 21, 2022.

On April 21, 2022, Epic invoked payment of `1,151 crore (US $140 million) out of `3,618 crore (US $440 million) Letter of Credit provided as security, towards compensatory damages awarded by the District Court and confirmed by the Appeals Court, already provided for in the earlier years.

On July 1, 2022, the District Court passed an Order affirming the punitive damages at `1,151 crore (US $140 million). The Company has filed an appeal on November 16, 2022, in the Appeals Court to reduce the punitive damages awarded by the District Court, which is pending.

Pursuant to encashment of the Letter of Credit towards compensatory damages, the value of Letter of Credit made available to Epic stands reduced to `1,250 crore (US $152 million).

# • Letter of comfort

The Company has given letter of comfort to banks for credit facilities availed by its subsidiaries. As per the terms of letter of comfort, the Company undertakes not to divest its ownership interest directly or indirectly in the subsidiary and provide such managerial, technical and financial assistance to ensure continued successful operations of the subsidiary.

# Other Information

The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Company’s annual report, but does not include the financial statements and auditor’s report(s) thereon. The Company’s annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.

Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

With respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit/ loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

# Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the Standalone Financial Statements

The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act.

Management and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease.




# Standalone Financial Statements

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of standalone financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on the standalone financial statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited for the year ended 31 March 2023

# Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid standalone financial statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act

(Referred to in paragraph 2(A)(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report of even date)

# Opinion

We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited (“the Company”) as of 31 March 2023 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.

In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and such internal financial controls were operating effectively as at 31 March 2023, based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “Guidance Note”).

# Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls

The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.

# Auditors’ Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements.

# Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements

A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of standalone financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of standalone financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the standalone financial statements.

# Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

# 1) Corporate information

Tata Consultancy Services Limited (referred to as “TCS Limited” or “the Company”) provides IT services, consulting and business solutions and has been partnering with many of the world’s largest businesses in their transformation journeys. The Company offers a consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions. This is delivered through its unique Location-Independent Agile delivery model recognised as a benchmark of excellence in software development.

The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in India. The address of its corporate office is TCS House, Raveline Street, Fort, Mumbai- 400001. As at March 31, 2023, Tata Sons Private Limited, the holding company owned 72.27% of the Company’s equity share capital.

The Board of Directors approved the standalone financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2023 and authorised for issue on April 12, 2023.

# 2) Statement of compliance

These standalone financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (referred to as “Ind AS”) as prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to time.

# 3) Basis of preparation

These standalone financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured at fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

All assets and liabilities have been classified as current and non-current as per the Company’s normal operating cycle. Based on the nature of services rendered to customers and time elapsed between deployment of resources and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the consideration for such services rendered, the Company has considered an operating cycle of 12 months.

The statement of cash flows has been prepared under indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated. The Company considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value to be cash equivalents.

These standalone financial statements have been prepared in Indian Rupee (`) which is the functional currency of the Company. Foreign currency transactions are recorded at exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet dates and exchange gains and losses arising on settlement and restatement are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not retranslated.

The significant accounting policies used in preparation of the standalone financial statements have been discussed in the respective notes.

# Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of standalone financial statements in conformity with the recognition and measurement principles of Ind AS requires management of the Company to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent liabilities as at the date of standalone financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the periods presented.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected.

The Company uses the following critical accounting estimates in preparation of its standalone financial statements:

# Revenue recognition

Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using percentage-of-completion method. The Company uses judgement to estimate the future cost-to-completion of the contracts which is used to determine degree of completion of the performance obligation.

# Useful lives of property, plant and equipment

The Company reviews the useful life of property, plant and equipment at the end of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation expense in future periods.

# Impairment of investments in subsidiaries

The Company reviews its carrying value of investments carried at cost (net of impairment, if any) annually, or more frequently when there is indication for impairment. If the recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is accounted for in the statement of profit and loss.

# Fair value measurement of financial instruments

When the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their

Standalone Financial Statements 2022-23 | 266

Fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

Covered by an option to extend the lease if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Company is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. In assessing whether the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a lease, it considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Company to exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease. The Company revises the lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period of a lease. The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.

# (e) Provision for income tax and deferred tax assets

The Company uses estimates and judgements based on the relevant rulings in the areas of allocation of revenue, costs, allowances and disallowances which is exercised while determining the provision for income tax. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised. Accordingly, the Company exercises its judgement to reassess the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period.

# (f) Provisions and contingent liabilities

The Company estimates the provisions that have present obligations as a result of past events and it is probable that outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.

The Company uses significant judgements to assess contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are recognised when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the standalone financial statements.

# 5) Recent pronouncements

Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On March 31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, applicable from April 1, 2023, as below:

- Ind AS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements: The amendments require companies to disclose their material accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies. Accounting policy information, together with other information, is material when it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary users of general purpose financial statements. The Company does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements.
- Ind AS 12 – Income Taxes: The amendments clarify how companies account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations. The amendments narrowed the scope of the recognition exemption in paragraphs 15 and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so that it no longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, in its financial statements.

# (g) Employee benefits

The accounting of employee benefit plans in the nature of defined benefit requires the Company to use assumptions. These assumptions have been explained under employee benefits note.

# (h) Leases

The Company evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. Identification of a lease requires significant judgement. The Company uses significant judgement in assessing the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate.

The Company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with both periods anticipated.

Estimates and Errors: The amendments will help entities to distinguish between accounting policies and accounting estimates. The definition of a change in accounting estimates has been replaced with a definition of accounting estimates. Under the new definition, accounting estimates are “monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty”. Entities develop accounting estimates if accounting policies require items in financial statements to be measured in a way that involves.

measurement uncertainty. The Company does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its financial statements.

# 6) Financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured on initial recognition of financial asset or financial liability.

The Company derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired.

# Cash and cash equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value, to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.

The Company designates certain foreign exchange forward, currency options and futures contracts as hedge instruments in respect of foreign exchange risks. These hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The Company uses hedging instruments that are governed by the policies of the Company which are approved by the Board of Directors. The policies provide written principles on the use of such financial derivatives consistent with the risk management strategy of the Company.

# Financial assets at amortised cost

Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

The hedge instruments are designated and documented as hedges at the inception of the contract. The Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows.

# Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income

Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and selling financial assets.

The effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce the risk associated with the exposure being hedged is assessed and measured at inception and on an ongoing basis. If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in other equity are immediately reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in the statement of profit and loss.

The Company has made an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of equity investments not held for trading in other comprehensive income. The effective portion of change in the fair value of the designated hedging instrument is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading cash flow hedging reserve.

# Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial recognition.

The Company separates the intrinsic value and time value of an option and designates as hedging instruments only the change in intrinsic value of the option. The change in fair value of the intrinsic value.

Standalone Financial Statements 2022-23 | 268

and time value of an option is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accounted as a separate component of equity. Such amounts are reclassified into the statement of profit and loss when the related hedged items affect profit and loss.

# Impairment of financial assets (other than at fair value)

The Company assesses at each date of balance sheet whether a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. Ind AS 109 requires expected credit losses to be measured through a loss allowance. The Company recognises lifetime expected losses for all contract assets and / or all trade receivables that do not constitute a financing transaction. In determining the allowances for doubtful trade receivables, the Company has used a practical expedient by computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward looking information. The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and allowance rates used in the provision matrix. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-months expected credit losses or at an amount equal to the life time expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition.

# Instruments not in hedging relationship

The Company enters into contracts that are effective as hedges from an economic perspective, but they do not qualify for hedge accounting. The change in the fair value of such instrument is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

Loans include inter-corporate deposits of `5,386 crore, with original maturity period within 10 months. Carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans and trade payables as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, approximate the fair value due to their nature. Carrying amounts of bank deposits, earmarked balances with banks, other financial assets and other financial liabilities which are subsequently measured at amortised cost also approximate the fair value due to their nature in each of the periods presented. Fair value measurement of lease liabilities is not required. Fair value of investments carried at amortised cost is `5,351 crore and `1,470 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

# (k) Fair value hierarchy

The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable and consists of the following three levels:

- Level 1 – Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 – Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3 – Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.

The cost of unquoted investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy approximate their fair value because there is a wide range of possible fair value measurements and the cost represents estimate of fair value within that range.

# (l) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activity

The Company’s revenue is denominated in various foreign currencies. Given the nature of the business, a large portion of the costs are denominated in Indian Rupee. This exposes the Company to currency fluctuations.

The Board of Directors has constituted a Risk Management Committee (RMC) to frame, implement and monitor the risk management plan of the Company which inter-alia covers risks arising out of exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Under the guidance and framework provided by the RMC, the Company uses various derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward, currency options and futures contracts in which the counter party is generally a bank.

# (m) Financial risk management

The Company is exposed primarily to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, which may adversely impact the fair value of its financial instruments. The Company has a risk management policy which covers risks associated with the financial assets and liabilities. The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors. The focus of the risk management committee is to assess the unpredictability of the financial environment and to mitigate potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Company.

# Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit, liquidity and other market changes. The Company’s exposure to market risk is primarily on account of foreign currency exchange rate risk.

# Foreign currency exchange rate risk

The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets / liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company. Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Company operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries.

The Company, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange. Further, any movement in the functional currency of the various operations of the Company against major foreign currencies may impact the Company’s revenue in international business.

The Company evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks. It hedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management policies.

The foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure and a simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the functional currency of the Company.

The following analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures of the Company as of the date of balance sheet which could affect the statements of profit and loss and other comprehensive income and equity. Further the exposure as indicated below is mitigated by some of the derivative contracts entered into by the Company as disclosed in note 6(l).

# Unhedged foreign currency exposure as at March 31, 2023:

|                           | USD      | EUR   | GBP     | Others  |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ----- | ------- | ------- |
| Net financial assets      | 2,747    | 91    | 436     | 2,736   |
| Net financial liabilities | (12,419) | (723) | (1,923) | (1,108) |

10% appreciation / depreciation of the functional currency of the Company with respect to various foreign currencies would result in increase / decrease in the Company’s profit before taxes by approximately `1,016 crore for the year ended March 31, 2023.

# Unhedged foreign currency exposure as at March 31, 2022:

|                           | USD     | EUR   | GBP     | Others  |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ------- | ------- |
| Net financial assets      | 515     | 89    | 147     | 1,709   |
| Net financial liabilities | (8,981) | (513) | (1,403) | (1,049) |

10% appreciation / depreciation of the functional currency of the Company with respect to various foreign currencies would result in increase / decrease in the Company’s profit before taxes by approximately `949 crore for the year ended March 31, 2022.

# • Interest rate risk

The Company’s investments are primarily in fixed rate interest bearing investments. Hence, the Company is not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.

# Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the contractual terms or obligations. Credit risk encompasses both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of customers on a continuous basis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit.

Financial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk principally consist of trade receivables, loans, investments, derivative financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and other financial assets. Bank deposits include an amount of `2,428 crore held with three banks having high credit rating which is individually in excess of 10% or more of the Company’s total bank deposits as at March 31, 2023. None of the other financial instruments of the Company result in material concentration of credit risk.

# • Exposure to credit risk

The carrying amount of financial assets and contract assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk was `90,655 crore and `90,388 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, being the total of the carrying amount of balances with banks, bank deposits, investments excluding equity and preference investments, trade receivables, loans, contract assets and other financial assets.

The Company’s exposure to customers is diversified and no single customer contributes to more than 10% of outstanding trade receivable and contract assets as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022.

# • Geographic concentration of credit risk

Geographic concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is as follows:

|                          | As at March 31, 2023 |       | As at March 31, 2022 |       |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ----- | -------------------- | ----- |
|                          | Gross%               | Net%  | Gross%               | Net%  |
| United States of America | 54.14                | 55.13 | 52.43                | 53.78 |
| India                    | 12.03                | 10.37 | 12.73                | 10.68 |

Geographic concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is allocated based on the location of the customers.

The allowance for lifetime expected credit loss on trade receivables for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 was `98 crore and `96 crore, respectively. The reconciliation of allowance for doubtful trade receivables is as follows:

|                                      | (\` crore) |   | Year ended March 31, 2023 | Year ended March 31, 2022 |

# 7) Leases

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

Company as a lessee

The Company accounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from non-lease components of the contract and allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative standalone price of the lease component and the aggregate standalone price of the non-lease components.

,nte˥˳ated ƪnnXal 5e˱o˳t 2022-23 Standalone Financial Statements 2022-23 | 285

Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements

The Company recognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease commencement date. The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

The Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably similar characteristics, the Company, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable lease payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Company recognises the amount of the re-measurement of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of profit and loss depending upon the nature of modification. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Company recognises any remaining amount of the re-measurement in statement of profit and loss.

The Company has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

# Company as a lessor

At the inception of the lease the Company classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The Company recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In case of a finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net investment in the lease. When the Company is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Company applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.

If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Company applies Ind AS 115 Revenue from contracts with customers to allocate the consideration in the contract.

# 8) Non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities

# (a) Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost comprising of purchase price and any initial directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use, less accumulated depreciation (other than freehold land) and impairment loss, if any.

Depreciation is provided for property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis so as to expense the cost less residual value over their estimated useful lives based on a technical evaluation. The estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any change in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.

# Estimated Useful Lives

| Type of asset            | Useful lives |
| ------------------------ | ------------ |
| Buildings                | 20 years     |
| Leasehold improvements   | Lease term   |
| Plant and equipment      | 10 years     |
| Computer equipment       | 4 years      |
| Vehicles                 | 4 years      |
| Office equipment         | 2-5 years    |
| Electrical installations | 4-10 years   |
| Furniture and fixtures   | 5 years      |

Depreciation is not recorded on capital work-in-progress until construction and installation are complete and the asset is ready for its intended use.

Property, plant and equipment with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

# (b) Intangible assets

Intangible assets purchased are measured at cost as at the date of acquisition, as applicable, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment, if any.

Intangible assets consist of rights under licensing agreement and software licences which are amortised over licence period which equates the economic useful life ranging between 2-5 years on a straight-line basis over the period of its economic useful life.

Intangible assets with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

Intangible assets consist of the following:

# 10) Revenue recognition

The Company earns revenue primarily from providing IT services, consulting and business solutions. The Company offers a consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions.

Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.

- Revenue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on output basis measured by units delivered, efforts expended, number of transactions processed, etc.
- Revenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts where the Company is standing ready to provide services is recognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight-lined over the period of performance.
- In respect of other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognised using percentage-of-completion method (‘POC method’) of accounting with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of the performance obligation. The contract costs used in computing the revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.
- Revenue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and manufactured systems and third party software is recognised upfront at the point in time when the system / software is delivered to the customer. In cases where implementation and / or customisation services rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services and software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognised over time on a POC method.
- Revenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer.
- The solutions offered by the Company may include supply of third-party equipment or software. In such cases, revenue for supply of such third party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether the Company is acting as the principal or as an agent of the customer. The Company recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration when it is acting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.

Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue also excludes taxes collected from customers.

The Company’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. The Company assesses the products / services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables.

Judgement is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation. The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable consideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant financing component. Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for a distinct product or service from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Company allocates the elements of variable considerations to all the performance obligations of the contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct performance obligations.

The Company exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period of time. The Company considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered or who controls the asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of such product or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.

Revenue from subsidiaries is recognised based on transaction price which is at arm’s length.

Contract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for capitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The assessment of this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.

Contract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified as unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms.

Unearned and deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.

The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance based payments and / or milestone based progress payments. Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.

In accordance with Ind AS 37, the Company recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.

Contracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Company reviews modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In the event transaction price is revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.

The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature of services, industry verticals and geography.

# Revenue disaggregation by nature of services is as follows:

# Information about major customers

No single customer represents 10% or more of the Company’s total revenue during the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022.

While disclosing the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or partially) satisfied performance obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognise those revenues, the Company has applied the practical expedient in Ind AS 115. Accordingly, the Company has not disclosed the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations which pertain to contracts where revenue recognised corresponds to the value transferred to customer typically involving time and material, outcome based and event based contracts.

Unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations are subject to variability due to several factors such as terminations, changes in scope of contracts, periodic revalidations of the estimates, economic factors (changes in currency rates, tax laws etc). The aggregate value of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations is 1,13,145 crore out of which 55.41% is expected to be recognised as revenue in the next year and the balance thereafter. No consideration from contracts with customers is excluded from the amount mentioned above.

# 12) Employee benefits

# Defined benefit plans

For defined benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Past service cost, both vested and unvested, is recognised as an expense at the earlier of (a) when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs; and (b) when the entity recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits.

The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.

The Company provides benefits such as gratuity, pension and provident fund (Company managed fund) to its employees which are treated as defined benefit plans.

# Defined contribution plans

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to such benefits.

The Company provides benefits such as superannuation and foreign defined contribution plans to its employees which are treated as defined contribution plans.

# Short-term employee benefits

All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short-term employee benefits. Benefits such as salaries, wages etc. and the expected cost of ex-gratia are recognised in the period in which the employee renders the related service. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid when there is a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

# Compensated absences

Compensated absences which are expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related services are recognised as undiscounted liability at the balance sheet date. Compensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related services are recognised as an actuarially determined liability at the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date using the Projected Unit Credit Method.

# Employee benefit plans consist of the following:

# Gratuity and pension

In accordance with Indian law, the Company operates a scheme of gratuity which is a defined benefit plan. The gratuity plan provides for a lump sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death while in employment or on termination of employment of an amount equivalent to 15 to 30 days’ salary payable for each completed year of service. Vesting occurs upon completion of five continuous years of service. The Company manages the plan through a trust. Trustees administer contributions made to the trust. Certain overseas branches of the Company also provide for retirement benefit plans in accordance with the local laws.

The assumptions used in accounting for the defined benefit plan are set out below:

|                                                              | As at March 31, 2023 | As at March 31, 2022  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Discount rate                                                | 7.50% / 3.90%-4.80%  | 7.00% / 1.50%-2.70%   |
| Rate of increase in compensation levels of covered employees | 6.00% / 1.95%-3.62%  | 6.00% / 2.24%-3.80%   |
| Rate of return on plan assets                                | 7.50% / 3.90%-4.80%  | 7.00% / 1.50%-2.70%   |
| Weighted average duration of defined benefit obligations     | 7 Years / 3-8 Years  | 8 years / 3-6.4 years |

Future mortality assumptions are taken based on the published statistics by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India.

The expected benefits are based on the same assumptions as are used to measure the Company’s defined benefit plan obligations as at March 31, 2023. The Company does not expect to contribute to defined benefit plan obligations funds for year ending March 31, 2024 in view of adequate surplus plan assets as at March 31, 2023.

The significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligations are discount rate and expected salary increase. The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.

If the discount rate increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows:

|                   | As at March 31, 2023 | As at March 31, 2022 |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Increase of 0.50% | (121)                | (159)                |
| Decrease of 0.50% | 127                  | 170                  |

If the expected salary growth increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows:

|                   | As at March 31, 2023 | As at March 31, 2022 |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Increase of 0.50% | 129                  | 171                  |
| Decrease of 0.50% | (123)                | (161)                |

The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligations as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.

Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligations has been calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the balance sheet.

Each year an Asset- Liability matching study is performed in which the consequences of the strategic investment policies are analysed in terms of risk and return profiles. Investment and contribution policies are integrated within this study.

# The defined benefit obligations shall mature after the year ended March 31, 2023 as follows:

| Year ending March 31, | Defined benefit obligations (\` crore) |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 2024                  | 636                                    |

# Provident fund

In accordance with Indian law, all eligible employees of the Company in India are entitled to receive benefits under the provident fund plan in which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to a trust set up by the Company to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees. This plan is a defined benefit plan as the Company is obligated to provide its members a rate of return which should, at the minimum, meet the interest rate declared by Government administered provident fund. A part of the Company’s contribution is transferred to Government administered pension fund. The contributions made by the Company and the shortfall of interest, if any, are recognised as an expense in statement of profit and loss under employee benefit expenses. In accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund liabilities on the basis of guidance issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions as mentioned below, there is no deficiency in the interest cost as the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than the expected amount to be credited to the individual members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of Government administered provident fund.

# The details of fund and plan assets are given below:

|                                              | As at March 31, 2023 | As at March 31, 2022 |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Fair value of plan assets                    | 25,511               | 22,814               |
| Present value of defined benefit obligations | (25,511)             | (22,814)             |
| Net excess / (shortfall)                     | -                    | -                    |

The plan assets have been primarily invested in Government securities and corporate bonds.

# The principal assumptions used in determining the present value obligation of interest guarantee under the deterministic approach are as follows:

|                                                  | As at March 31, 2023 | As at March 31, 2022 |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Discount rate                                    | 7.50%                | 7.00%                |
| Average remaining tenure of investment portfolio | 7 Years              | 8 years              |
| Guaranteed rate of return                        | 8.15%                | 8.10%                |

The Company expensed `1,614 crore and `1,372 crore for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, towards provident fund.

# 15) Income taxes

Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the year. Current and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

Current income taxes

The current income tax expense includes income taxes payable by the Company having its branches in India and overseas where it operates. The current tax payable by the Company in India is Indian income tax payable on income after taking credit for tax relief available for export operations in Special Economic Zones (SEZs).

Current income tax payable by overseas branches of the Company is computed in accordance with the tax laws applicable in the jurisdiction in which the respective branch operates. The taxes paid are generally available for set off against the Indian income tax liability of the Company’s worldwide income.

Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax paid and income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying unit intends to settle the asset and liability on a net basis.

Deferred income taxes

Deferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount, except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.

Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements

Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be received or settled.

For operations carried out in SEZs, deferred tax assets or liabilities, if any, have been established for the tax consequences of those temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases that reverse after the tax holiday ends.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the relevant entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Deferred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, to the extent it would be available for set off against future current income tax liability. Accordingly, MAT is recognised as deferred tax asset in the balance sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will be realised.

# Other claims

Claims aggregating `218 crore and `235 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, against the Company have not been acknowledged as debts.

In addition to above, in October 2014, Epic Systems Corporation (referred to as Epic) filed a legal claim against the Company in the Court of Western District Madison, Wisconsin alleging unauthorised access to and download of their confidential information and use thereof in the development of the Company’s product MedMantra.

In April 2016, the Company received an unfavourable jury verdict awarding damages of `7,730 crore (US $940 million) to Epic which was thereafter reduced by the Trial Court to `3,454 crore (US $420 million). Pursuant to reaffirmation of the District Court Order in March 2019, the Company filed an appeal in the Appeals Court to fully set aside the Order. Epic also filed a cross appeal challenging the reduction by the District Court judge of `822 crore (US $100 million) award and `1,645 crore (US $200 million) in punitive damages.

On August 20, 2020, the Appeals Court (a) vacated the award of `2,303 crore (US $280 million) in punitive damages considering the award to be constitutionally excessive and remanded the case back to District Court with instructions to reassess and reduce the punitive damages award to at most `1,151 crore (US $140 million), (b) affirmed the District Court’s decision vacating the jury’s award of `822 crore (US $100 million) in compensatory damages for alleged use of “other confidential information” by the Company, and, (c) affirmed the District Court’s decision upholding the jury’s award of `1,151 crore (US $140 million) in compensatory damages for use of the comparative analysis by the Company. Considering all the facts and various legal precedence, on a conservative and prudent basis, the Company provided `1,218 crore (US $165 million) towards this legal claim in its statement of profit and loss for three month period ended September 30, 2020. This was presented as an “exceptional item” in the standalone statement of profit and loss. On April 8, 2021, Epic approached the Supreme Court seeking review of the Order of the Appeals Court which was denied by the Supreme Court on March 21, 2022.

On April 21, 2022, Epic invoked payment of `1,151 crore (US $140 million) out of `3,618 crore (US $440 million) Letter of Credit provided as security, towards compensatory damages awarded by the District Court and confirmed by the Appeals Court, already provided for in the earlier years.

On July 1, 2022, the District Court passed an Order affirming the punitive damages at `1,151 crore (US $140 million). The Company has filed an appeal on November 16, 2022, in the Appeals Court to reduce the punitive damages awarded by the District Court, which is pending.

Pursuant to encashment of the Letter of Credit towards compensatory damages, the value of Letter of Credit made available to Epic stands reduced to `1,250 crore (US $152 million).

# Climate change risk and opportunities assessment and management

# Aligned with Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Framework

# Governance

# A) Describe the board’s oversight of climate-related risks &#x26; opportunities.

Different Board committees oversee different aspects of climate-related risks and opportunities.

# Stakeholder Relationship Committee (SRC)

- The SRC is chaired by an independent director and comprises of 3 members including the CEO. It reviews the climate change strategy, approach, and performance of the organization.
- The SRC formally meets twice every year to review policies and sustainability performance, including climate change and carbon performance. The board oversight helps drive the program effectively with greater accountability.
- The CEO as a part of the SRC, is directly responsible for the efficient operations of the facility and hence is better able to review performance and drive improvement. The quarterly updates go from the Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) and is supported by the Head- Environmental Sustainability, Health and Safety.
- TCS’ carbon reduction goal to reduce its absolute greenhouse gas emissions across Scope 1 and Scope 2 by 70% by 2025 (over 2016 base year), and to achieve net zero emissions by 2030, was reviewed and approved by the committee.

# Risk Management Committee (RMC)

- The RMC is chaired by an independent director and comprises of 5 members including one additional independent director, 2 executive directors, i.e., CEO, COO, and one company executive, CFO.
- The RMC formulates, monitors, and reviews the company’s risk management policy.
- Climate change risks and opportunities are covered under the strategic and operational risks for the Company and are reviewed in the RMC committee meetings.

# Corporate Social Responsibility Committee (CSRC)

- The CSRC is chaired by the Company’s Chairman and additionally comprises one independent director and one executive director. The committee formulates, monitors, and reviews the company’s CSR policy and outcomes, including climate action related projects.
- The Board members meet on a quarterly basis and review their activities.

# B) Describe management’s role in assessing &#x26; managing climate-related risks &#x26; opportunities.

- The Chief Operating Officer is responsible for overall ESG related challenges, targets and achievements.
- Responsibility for driving and tracking climate change mitigation initiatives lies with the Chief Human Resources Officer. He reports to the Board sub-committee on sustainability related matters. Head, Environmental Sustainability Health and Safety (ESHS) reports to the CHRO. The ESHS team comprises of environmental sustainability professionals who monitor various climate change related data points including emissions and support the implementation of emission reduction initiatives across TCS locations in collaboration with action owners within the organization. Location level targets are monitored by the location level operations and ESHS teams.
- For environmental risk assessment, mitigation, and adaptation, TCS has a well-defined structure with an Enterprise Risk Management Unit which is headed by a Chief Risk Officer. This unit reviews all risks associated with the company operations. ERM categorizes risks and opportunities into Strategic, Operational, Financial, Compliance and Catastrophic.
- The risk identification process is carried out for the entire organization and its value chain to assess all risks including the physical, compliance, operational and reputational risks due to climate change and the business opportunities associated with it. Unit level risk assessments are done to assess the physical risks of climate change. These are then rolled up to the enterprise-level risk portfolio register and suitably included. These risks are reviewed on a half yearly basis or as required.
- As TCS’ customers respond to climate change actions, the company is seeing opportunities to provide technology-led solutions to help them achieve their sustainability goals. Recent events have accelerated digital adoption, put the spotlight on supply chain resilience and added urgency to the sustainability imperative.

Additionally, TCS is one of the market leaders in the cloud migration opportunity, helping clients migrate their workloads from owned data centers to hyperscaler clouds, significantly reducing the carbon footprint associated with those workloads. |
| **Legal**               | TCS tracks environmental legal compliance (air emissions, water discharges, waste management and others) on a periodic basis and has a robust internal compliance management system to identify and comply with all legal requirements of current, amended and new regulations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Market**              | Climate change is driving a lot of changes in TCS’ customer behaviour, thus creating new markets and new opportunities, giving the company an opportunity to partner with them in their climate change mitigation journey by providing solutions, services, and process automation which helps in emission reduction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Reputation**          | Reputational risk is relevant to the company as the investor and customer community is becoming increasingly aware of climate change related issues. It is important to demonstrate leadership in climate action to maintain TCS’ reputation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Acute physical**      | Acute physical risks associated with extreme weather events is relevant as TCS has substantial operations in coastal cities in India which are exposed to potential extreme weather events like heavy precipitation, flood, and cyclones. E.g., The company offices located in coastal cities like Chennai, Bhubaneshwar, Kolkata, Kochi are exposed to physical risks from cyclonic events and therefore adequate mitigation plans are in place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Chronic physical**    | Having presence in many major cities across the world, TCS is subject to climate change related chronic physical impacts like change in precipitation pattern, with resultant effects like drought or flood. Also, with TCS’s presence in coastal cities like Chennai, Mumbai, Kochi, Trivandrum, Kolkata, rise in sea level and related impacts like land submergence, salt water intrusion, disruption to network and communication systems are more likely. These risks are long term and included from perspective of planning appropriate infrastructure.                                                                                                                            |

TCS has aligned its current systems of internal financial control with the requirement of Companies Act 2013, on the lines of the globally accepted risk-based framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission.

The Internal Control – Integrated Framework (the 2013 framework) is intended to increase transparency and accountability in an organization’s process of designing and implementing a system of internal control. The framework requires a company to identify and analyze risks and manage appropriate responses. The company has successfully laid down the framework and ensured its effectiveness.

Climate risks and opportunities are the key factors while making financial considerations especially while making investments in offices, equipment, and renewable energy. Investment in these areas constitutes a substantial share of the company’s overall capital investment. Major investments are in green buildings, roof top solar and other energy efficiency initiatives. In FY 2023 TCS has invested ₹3,063 crore in projects to improve environmental and social impacts. These investments, along with other mitigation steps, helped the company reduce its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 71% from base year 2016. These initiatives also help the company to position itself as a leader in the climate domain contributing to TCS’ market value.

# C) Describe the resilience of the organization’s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2 degree Celsius or lower scenario

# Climate related Parameters, assumptions, analytical choices scenario

# Transition scenarios

The climate change scenario analysis conducted for TCS takes a multi-level approach to identify climate risk and opportunity hot spots, interdependencies, and interaction with global macro trends. The top-down analysis of the macro environmental trends that will impact the company at global level included a) nature loss and ecological degradation, b) resource scarcity and driving value chain innovation, c) changing customer and workforce preferences, d) the rise of extreme weather, e) increasing regulations, pricing and disclosure of externalities, f) digitalization and prevalence of infectious diseases and g) rising incomes.

Detailed analysis was conducted of material climate change transition risks and opportunities across value chain and assessment of interdependencies between climate risks and opportunities including identification of areas of potential magnification and hedge opportunities.

The key value drivers analysis assesses climate risks and opportunities across 3 stages of the value chain including a) Supply Chain (input supplies costs, disruption and access to supplies) b) Operations (carbon costs, operating costs, insurance/ damage costs due to disruption of operation) and c) End markets (demand for low carbon services/ products, market share and competition). In the transition scenario, the IEA B2DS approach has been selected as its more conservative scenario. The inputs included IPCC reports, the NDCs, the SDGs and Government of India plan on energy efficiency and solar energy. The assumptions used in the analysis also considered the anticipated growth of TCS over the years and increased energy demand.

Changing customer behavior and carbon costs are assessed as a transition risk to TCS with a growing number of jurisdictions at regional and national level planning to implement a carbon tax or emission trading scheme.




# Physical climate scenarios RCP 8.5

The climate change scenario analysis conducted for TCS had a multi-level approach to identify climate risk and opportunity hot spots, interdependencies, and interaction with global macro trends. The top-down analysis of the macro environmental trends that will impact the company at global level included:

- a) nature loss and ecological degradation,
- b) resource scarcity and driving value chain innovation,
- c) changing customer and workforce preferences,
- d) the rise of extreme weather,
- e) increasing regulations, pricing and disclosure of externalities,
- f) digitalization and prevalence of infectious diseases and
- g) rising incomes.

Detailed analysis was conducted on:

- a) material climate change physical risks and opportunities across value chain, and
- b) assessment of interdependencies between climate risks and opportunities including identification of areas of potential magnification and hedge opportunities.

The key value drivers’ analysis assesses climate risks and opportunities across 3 stages of the value chain including:

- a) Supply Chain (input supplies costs, disruption and access to supplies),
- b) Operations (carbon costs, operating costs, insurance/damage costs due to disruption of operation),
- c) End Markets (demand for low carbon services/products, market share and competition).

The physical risk is assessed using the RCP 8.5 scenario. The RCP 8.5 scenario takes a global warming between 3-4 degrees above pre-industrial levels which is a conservative scenario and helps us understand the worst-case climate impacts on our operations.

Inputs for the assessment included IPCC reports, the NDCs, the SDGs and Government of India plan on energy efficiency and solar energy. The assumptions used in the analysis also considered the anticipated growth of TCS over the years and increased energy demand.

Few strategies to mitigate physical risks of climate change include:

1. A robust Business Continuity Plan (BCP) to respond to climate events.
2. Investments in climate resilient infrastructure (for cyclone, floods).

# Risk Management

A) Describe the organization’s processes for identifying and assessing climate related risks

B) Describe the organization’s processes for managing climate-related risks

Independent Assurance Statement

The Management and Board of Directors

Tata Consultancy Services Limited,

Mumbai, India

# Scope

We have been engaged by Tata Consultancy Services Limited to perform a ‘limited assurance engagement,’ as defined by International Standards on Assurance Engagements, hereafter referred to as the engagement, to report on Tata Consultancy Services Limited Integrated Annual Report FY 23 (the “Subject Matter”) for the period from 01st April 2022 to 31st March 2023.

Other than as described in the preceding paragraph, which sets out the scope of our engagement, we did not perform assurance procedures on the remaining information included in the Report, and accordingly, we do not express a conclusion on this information.

# Criteria applied by Tata Consultancy Services Limited

In preparing the integrated report, Tata Consultancy Services Limited applied, The International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC framework), and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. GRI Standards were specifically designed for the Integrated Annual Report FY 23; As a result, the subject matter information may not be suitable for another purpose.

# TCS’s responsibilities

Tata Consultancy Services Limited management is responsible for selecting the Criteria, and for presenting the integrated report in accordance with that Criteria, in all material respects. This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining internal controls, maintaining adequate records, and making estimates relevant to the preparation of the subject matter, such that it is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

# EY’s responsibilities

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the presentation of the Subject Matter based on the evidence we have obtained.

We conducted our engagement in accordance with the International Standard for Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (‘ISAE 3000’), and the terms of reference for this engagement as agreed with Tata Consultancy Services Limited. Those standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether, in all material respects, the Subject Matter is presented in accordance with the Criteria, and to issue a report. The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risk of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

# Sustainability Disclosures

EY also applies International Standard on Quality Control 1, Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Financial Statements, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements, and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

# Description of procedures performed

Procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Our procedures were designed to obtain a limited level of assurance on which to base our conclusion and do not provide all the evidence that would be required to provide a reasonable level of assurance.

Although we considered the effectiveness of management’s internal controls when determining the nature and extent of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on internal controls. Our procedures did not include testing controls or performing procedures relating to checking aggregation or calculation of data within IT systems.

A limited assurance engagement consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for preparing the integrated report and related information and applying analytical and other appropriate procedures.

# Our procedures included:

- Conducted interviews with select personnel at sites and corporate teams to understand the process for collecting, collating and reporting the subject matter as per Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards;
- Checked that the calculation criteria have been correctly applied in accordance with the methodologies outlined in the Criteria;
- Undertook analytical review procedures to support the reasonableness of the data;
- Verification of data, on a selective test basis, for the following sites, through consultations with the site team and sustainability team:
- Siruseri, Chennai
- Gitanjali Park, Newtown, Kolkata
- Mihan, Nagpur
- Pampanga, Philippines
- Guadalajara, Mexico
- Corporate office, Mumbai
- Execution of an audit trail of claims and data streams, on a selective test basis, to determine the level of accuracy in collection, transcription and aggregation processes followed;
- Review of the Company's plans, policies and practices, pertaining to their social, environment and sustainable development, so as to be able to make comments on the fairness of sustainability reporting;
- Review of the Company's approach towards materiality assessment disclosed in the Report to identify relevant issues;
- Review of selected qualitative statements in various sections of the integrated report.

We also performed such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

# Emphasis of matter

The assurance scope excludes:

- Data and information outside the defined reporting period (1st April 2022 to 31st March 2023);
- Data and information on economic and financial performance of the Company.




# Integrated Annual Report FY 23

• The Company's statements that describe the expression of opinion, belief, inference, aspiration, expectation, aim or future intention provided by the Company

# Conclusion

Based on our procedures and the evidence obtained, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the Integrated Annual Report FY 23 for the period from 01ˢᵗ April 2022 to 31ˢᵗ March 2023, in order for it to be in accordance with the Criteria.
