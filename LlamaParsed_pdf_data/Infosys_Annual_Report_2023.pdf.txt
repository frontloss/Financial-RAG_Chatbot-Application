# Generative AI and You

# Integrated Annual Report 2023-24


# Gen AI: Ushering in the next era of business

We barely saw it happen. AI walking into our lives. Through the ads that follow us on social media. The personalized pick of movies and shows. Our cars. The maps helping us navigate. Right there in our hands – our super-powerful phones. And now, it’s happening again. This time with generative AI. In the form of handy tools – like ChatGPT, MetaAI and Stable Diffusion – that pique our imagination, and stoke our curiosity.

Generative AI technology’s path into enterprises too has been just as accelerated and enthusiastic, supported by an exponential increase in investments. While almost every enterprise has started working with generative AI, their struggles with data readiness and concerns around regulatory compliance are just as real. A common acknowledgment is that very few of the gen AI pilots, when considered at scale, promise to deliver tangible business value. In the months to follow, we believe, some ongoing AI pilots will scale to strategic AI programs that will then help pave the way for AI-led business transformations.

Our clients, across industries, are looking to solve tough business challenges with generative AI in ways that produce measurable outcomes for them. For example, supporting and personalizing customer interactions, bringing greater efficiencies to marketing and sales, improving the quality of code, and even enhancing personal and organizational productivity. They also clearly see that the advent of generative AI, with potential for more pervasive automation, will accelerate the pace of workforce transformation. Talent, across functions, will need support to imbibe new skills, and some will even prep for entirely new jobs that didn’t exist before. Generative AI, if embraced responsibly, could drive productivity growth and support a more sustainable, inclusive world.

Embracing AI responsibly also means keeping track of emerging AI regulations across countries and jurisdictions while ensuring compliance. Existing processes, policies, guidelines, and tooling will need to be continuously reviewed and enhanced to cover model assurance, model security, bias, fairness, explainability, reproducibility, training data privacy, safety and alignment, IP/contractual risks and sustainability impact too. We are factoring it all in as we engineer enterprise-scale generative AI developments for our clients. You’ll come across some examples right here in this Integrated Annual Report. But what we hope you also won’t miss is to see how you too can navigate your next as generative AI paves the path forward for us all, and how Infosys can be the trusted partner on that journey into the future.

Microsoft Corporation: Transforming platform engineering.

# Transforming operations

Microsoft Corporation is a technology company that aspires to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. As a vocal advocate for the game-changing potential of artificial intelligence, Microsoft was eager to harness the power of AI, especially generative AI, to heighten their operational agility. This meant reengineering their operations analytics platform for better quality, faster response, and support. The platform is a trusted resource for several thousand users at Microsoft, offering insights and transactions support to manage their business operations across commercial, OEM, and partner channels.

To amplify and transform the platform with generative AI, Microsoft teamed up with Infosys. Infosys brought the capabilities of Azure OpenAI Service and GitHub Copilot to help solve this challenging problem. They also brought best practices for leveraging generative AI technologies for code generation and development support. Infosys used these techniques and started to reengineer the platform, factoring in user feedback while simultaneously addressing pitfalls preemptively and making efficiency projections. The aim was to transform the platform to meet changing user needs at a revolutionary rate. The outcome was a whopping 35% reduction in development effort and a 24% reduction in test-case generation and code review time. In fact, the platform was ready to deliver on Microsoft’s operational aspirations six months ahead of schedule!

The renewed operations platform delivers never-before-seen on-time, on-demand intelligence for users with hugely reduced data latency and cost across the 150+ reports of operational insights that the business counts on. The new generative AI-powered knowledge repository enables the platform’s support team to provide quicker responses to queries, resulting in an 18% reduction in support ticket volume. This newfound agility, along with the self-service capabilities added to the platform, has resulted in a sharp increase in internal customer satisfaction.

“Successful operations are all about effective support for the business, firmly grounding the core technology to make that possible, and being able to pivot with agility to meet changing market needs. Generative AI, Azure OpenAI Service, and GitHub Copilot, in the hands of capable Infosys engineers, helped us to transform and modernize our operations analytics platform to be able to meet the demands of our business while saving time, money, and delighting users with the experience.”

– Jonathan Chromy, Principal SWE Manager, Microsoft

Danske Bank: Scaling assistive technology organization-wide

Danske Bank is a Nordic bank, the largest retail bank in Denmark, with over 5 million retail customers. In the summer of 2023, the Bank announced its Forward ’28 strategy to strengthen the organization and create a more focused business trajectory to exceed its financial targets. With the maturing of generative AI, Danske Bank was quick to see its potential to revolutionize their industry and transform the way their own company operated, to increase efficiency and productivity, reduce costs, and open up new opportunities for growth. They were keen to start to explore a custom GPT indexed with their own business content to automate repetitive tasks and provide instant responses to tactical pursuits, freeing up human staff to focus on more strategic objectives.

Infosys responded with a plan to help Danske Bank set up an A-team and the appropriate generative AI technology to build a secure, ethical-by-design chat-based assistant – DanskeGPT. The intent was to prototype and scale a solution to accelerate personal productivity, first in a sandboxed environment for experimentation, while maintaining an abundance of caution that provides the guardrails to manage ethical and practical safeguards for issues like AI hallucinations. Microsoft’s Open AI services in Azure provided the foundation. From start to pilot, the solution was ready in about six weeks, and soon scaled for ethical and safe use for about 3,000 users.

Today, Danske Bank’s entire employee base is harnessing DanskeGPT’s capabilities to assist them in their everyday activities – already seeing a 10-15% boost in productivity in some areas. Team Infosys continues to work, enhancing DanskeGPT with internal data, to deliver for Danske Bank new content, and enable new process improvements through effective ways of employing this flexible assistant. The team is also helping the Bank to quickly identify the parts of their business where the technology could have the most immediate impact. The effort also includes strategic moves to assemble a cross-functional team, including data science practitioners, legal experts, and business leaders, to scale the continued AI-powered transformation of Danske Bank.

“We are rapidly building capability to tackle hundreds of AI-powered ideas to drive productivity across our business units. From better insights and reporting to identifying risks and vulnerabilities, while improving our customer and company outcomes, we are prioritizing and delivering services into the bank with support from Infosys.”

– Jan den Boer, Head Strategic Sourcing, Senior Vice President, Danske Bank

Currys: Driving step-change evolution of sales ROI

Currys is an international omnichannel retailer of technology products and services, operating online and across 720 stores in six countries, helping customers enjoy amazing technology, however they choose to shop. As the cost-of-living pressures escalated in the UK, Currys wanted to optimize its sales and service process for greater efficacy, so it was better able to deliver more value to its customers. Currys also clearly saw the need to be as efficient as possible through these efforts so it could sustain the program, increase productivity, and share the savings made with its customers. It was quick to see the advantage to be gained from using AI to execute on its pricing, personalization, e-commerce and service strategies.

Currys partnered with Infosys to build an ML- and AI-based price recommendation engine, co-developing decision-support capabilities and internal tooling, yielding strong predictive pricing performance. These recommendations are driving sustained profitable sales for Currys through better-adapted and optimized omnichannel pricing. With e-commerce bringing in 45% of Currys UK&#x26;I revenues, Infosys also simultaneously worked with Currys to develop an ML- and AI-powered online conversion analytics engine to unearth insights into customer journeys that impact conversion.

Currys is now advancing its exploration into the realm of generative AI. In tandem with Infosys, Currys is undertaking multiple programs to test and learn:

- Gen AI-powered tools to query and summarize lengthy product documentation to support internal teams on their information needs
- A smart repairs and services assistant to guide on simple fixes, with the potential to reduce false returns and call volumes
- Sentiment analysis and summarization based on customer feedback from surveys, to guide identification of opportunities to improve customer service experience.

“We exist to help everyone enjoy amazing technology. As a tech retailer, it’s in our DNA to embrace and harness new tech to improve the customer experience and help them choose, afford and enjoy new tech. With the combination of shared values, a love of technology and deep expertise in G(AI), Infosys is a natural partner for Currys.”

LG Electronics: Gaining from automated consumer insights for increasing digital sales

# LG Electronics: Gaining from automated consumer insights for increasing digital sales

LG Electronics is leading the global market in smart home appliances and consumer electronics. From a strategic standpoint of the brand, LG Electronics makes a solid and uncompromising promise to create a better life for their customers. They articulate it succinctly – Life’s Good. The company truly understands the power of harnessing cutting-edge technology to deliver on their promise. In fact, the company redefined AI as “Affectionate Intelligence,” with a conviction that AI can foster more empathetic and attentive customer experience. In fact, leveraging the company’s vast repository of user data, the LG AI Brain forecasts customers’ needs based on user-product interactions and contextual learning.

Having made significant progress on its AI journey, LG Electronics USA approached Infosys to implement a reliable and cost-efficient AI solution for automated consumer insights for digital channel and customer sentiment analysis that helps to increase digital sales. Traditionally, businesses grapple with fragmented data sources and often rely on costly third-party tools for customer insights. Infosys revolutionized the approach by creating a unified data architecture to seamlessly integrate disparate data sources, including CRM systems, digital marketing platforms, competitor data, social media platforms, customer feedback channels, and transactional databases. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies and best practices, the data fabric solution served as the foundation for our automated consumer insights initiative.

Infosys then conducted a Proof of Concept (POC) for customer sentiment analysis, leveraging the capabilities of our newly implemented data fabric by implementing a generative AI-powered sentiment analysis solution on Google Cloud, seamlessly integrating diverse data sources. This included data from sources such as Bazaar Voice, Intellytics, VoiceBot, ChatBot, and audio files. The generative AI solution included Chirp for speech-to-text conversion and Text Bison for sentiment analysis. Scalability, efficiency, and compliance with industry standards for data handling and model operationalization were seamlessly managed. The solution delivers up to 50% greater efficiencies with automated consumer insights. The solution is now planned to be moved into production.

LG Electronics USA, like Infosys, is acutely aware of their responsibility to deploy AI in an ethical manner. The company aims to develop AI systems that benefit all users, promote safe behavior and deliver delight to customers.

“Companies, like our own, are already trying to stay ahead by exploiting gen AI models in order to improve customer experience and harness exponential business growth. The next step for us will be to differentiate ourselves with the value that gen AI can deliver along with our own data and systems. There are significant opportunities for companies that want to push ahead with gen AI and we want to be recognized as a leader in this space. Infosys with their deep expertise and investments in gen AI is a natural partner of choice for us to help achieve our goals.”

– Sujatha Krishnan, Senior Director, Head of Data Solutions, LG Electronics USA

Chairman’s message

# What’s next for the generative AI revolution

We are into the second year of the generative AI revolution, and some clarity is beginning to emerge from the noise and babble of the last 18 months. The initial hyperventilation of AI doomerism and the risk of human extinction by AI advances like Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has quietened down. People have accepted that, like any other general-purpose technology be it electricity, nuclear energy, the internet or even a discovery like fire, gen AI has enormous potential for good when explored and advanced within the guardrails of responsibility.

Besides, many of the doomsday prophets pleading for extensive AI regulation have revealed themselves to be just protectionists who want to limit the fruits of gen AI to a few companies and investors. It is also clear that there won’t be a scenario where we’ll have ‘one model to rule them all’. Every day brings new advances in large language models from a dizzying set of actors all pushing for greater innovation. These range from very large models which need massive computing infrastructure to small ones that can run locally on the phone. The real power of AI will come from configuring all the different models and tools to get the best solutions.

This is not very different from previous generations of technology. What’s more, the rise of powerful open-source AI models has accelerated the deployment of AI to solve tough business and societal challenges. Although there could be concentration risk in the hardware and cloud infrastructure space, as we move into actual use cases, a thousand flowers will bloom.

It is more than evident that enterprise AI will be markedly different from consumer AI. The manifestations of consumer AI will be packaged in wondrous ways to make life easier and more productive for millions of people. New ways of conducting search; agents that help plan work and leisure; intuitive interfaces that can serve up what’s needed and reason with users; even speech recognition that understands the nuances of dialects and colloquialisms.

Above all, the gen AI revolution presents an unrivaled opportunity. The flux of change as the whole technological landscape is being reset will create many large openings. Packaged solutions will be reimagined, and we will see a resurgence of custom-built solutions that must be enabled.

Enterprise AI, on the other hand, requires a root and branch surgery of the complex and multigeneration technology (both legacy and modern), that lie within firms. The AI models themselves will become commodities. The challenge will be to orchestrate the extensive data inside with new types of AI building blocks. The puck is clearly and quickly moving to a place where the balance of advantage will be with Infosys.

Performance overview
Letter to the Shareholder

Dear shareholder,

Infosys is the leading company in AI and generative AI today. We are working on several projects with clients to help them benefit from generative AI. These projects are in software engineering, process optimization, customer support, advisory services, as well as sales and marketing. They are helping our clients reduce cost, improve service quality, connect with their customers and drive growth. We are working with market-leading open access and closed large language models. Our work in AI and generative AI is available to our clients using Infosys Topaz.

Enterprise AI is built using the data within enterprises. Here, our approach of narrow transformers, working deeply with enterprise data, brings significant benefit to our clients.

In addition, we have augmented our services with generative AI and developed playbooks for each of our offerings. We are among the first IT services companies globally to achieve ISO 42001:2023 certification, which is a testament to our commitment to excellence in AI management. We were ranked as a leader in AI services by seven out of eight leading analysts.

Infosys Cobalt capabilities for the cloud continue to resonate with our clients. We work closely with the major public cloud providers and on private cloud programs for our clients. Cloud, along with data, is the foundation for AI and generative AI.

Data within enterprises, from their customer experiences, from their employee and supplier interactions, becomes critical foundation for successful generative AI deployment. Our strength in data, as a result of our digital leadership, is helping ensure our clients are ready to leverage the opportunity presented by generative AI.

During the year, our relentless focus on execution enabled us to deliver growth and operating margin resilience. We generated US$2.9 billion of free cash flow. We worked closely with our clients on their cost, efficiency, automation, and consolidation programs to generate US$17.7 billion of large deals, the highest we have had annually, which showcases the relevance of our service offerings for clients.

As per our capital allocation policy, the final dividend of `20 per share and the special dividend of `8 per share for the financial year 2024 has been recommended by the Board for shareholder approval, which is a return of US$2.3 billion to shareholders.

We recruited nearly 11,900 college graduates in the year and ended the year with over 3,17,000 employees. Our attrition reduced to 12.6%. We trained over 2,50,000 employees on AI skills. Our focus on gender diversity continues with about 39% of our workforce consisting of women employees.

During the year, we were recognized as the only Indian firm in the top 100 of TIME Magazine’s list of World’s Best Companies of 2023. We were also recognized as a Top 100 brand globally by Kantar Brand Z and the fastest growing IT services brand over a 5-year period by Brand Finance.

We remain committed to the communities we live and operate in. With the work of Infosys Foundation, we continue to create positive impact in healthcare, education, sustainability, and women empowerment. The projects we undertake help to provide equitable support to those most in need of new opportunities. Our Springboard initiative continues to help build digital skills by providing free learning programs to 7.9 million people around the world.

Thanks to our clients for their incredible trust in us and for helping us become the leading AI-first, cloud-first, and digital-first company.

Thanks to our 3,17,000 employees for their enormous contribution to making our clients successful.

Thanks to our Board for their guidance and direction on our strategic approach.

With changing technology, our clients are keen to leverage these advances for their customers, operations, and employees. With our leadership in AI and generative AI, cloud, and digital, along with our diverse workforce around the world, we are well-positioned to support our clients today and in the future.

As I look ahead, I remain optimistic about the changes in technology and how these can make a positive impact on the world and our clients.

Salil Parekh

Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director

Over the past five years, from financial year 2020 to 2024 we have returned 85% of free cash flow to you, our shareholders.

With my warmest regards,

# Managing financial capital

Infosys has a high cash-generating business with access to capital markets across the world. Our strong credit rating allows us to raise debt at competitive rates in the future, if needed. The primary source of funds is cash from operations and income from short and long-term investments, among others.

Our consolidated cash and investments include deposits in banks, investments in liquid mutual funds, fixed maturity plan securities, commercial paper, quoted bonds issued by government and semi-government organizations, non-convertible debentures and CDs or certificates of deposits – all such instruments issued by eligible financial institutions with high credit ratings. We also build financial assets and create financial value by investing in the startup ecosystem. These investments enable us to access innovation, which together with our services and solutions, deliver benefits to our clients.

We maintain transparency in our disclosures and frequent communication with investors through channels such as quarterly post-result calls, analyst meets, the Annual General Meeting, and regular one-to-one and group interactions. Our market-oriented four-pronged strategy enables us to invest in expanding our global digital footprint. This helps Infosys to be recognized as a partner of choice for digital transformation and also increases our potential to attract larger total contract value (TCV) deals and clients. This enhances our ability to generate industry-leading growth and profitability, thus generating shareholder value.

(1) Dividend includes special dividend of `8.00 per share

# Employee Value Proposition

We never cease to reinforce our Employee Value Proposition (EVP). Our EVP continues to build on the three pillars of:

- Employee health and wellness
- Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
- Localization

Our career framework, articulated as Career Gambit, is a simple, intuitive framework that is focused on three important actions – Get, Set, Go.

# Get:

Access to world-class learning and personalized learning paths with digital readiness through Lex, our online learning platform, and Digital Quotient, a comprehensive score that helps employees keep track of their digital capabilities.

# Set:

Employees are encouraged to set themselves up to win, acquiring Skill Tags and setting sights on specialized careers through tools such as Digital Specialist. Once they complete the required courses and gain six months of experience in that skill set / technology, they qualify for a Skill Tag.

# Go:

Multiple pathways into exciting technology spaces through Bridge programs, Accelerate and Marketplace enhance employees’ mobility in this fast-paced technology world. These intelligent platforms match the right opportunity to the right individual at the right time for employees and business alike.

# Employee health and wellness

There is a stronger focus on individual and collective well-being in the hybrid work model. Employees who are comfortable and satisfied with work add to the productivity and success of the organization, while also leading happier and fulfilling lives.

Our reimagined listening mechanism for the new remote way of work is a periodic feedback mechanism called Pulse. Pulse collects ongoing and real-time feedback from employees anonymously on key organization-wide themes that shape an employee’s experience at Infosys such as work, learning and careers.

Over 1.60L+ employees participated in fiscal 2024. Employee satisfaction for fiscal 2024 was recorded at 80%.

# Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

As part of our ESG Vision 2030, we aim to achieve 45% female representation in our workforce by 2030. In fiscal 2024, we had 1,24,569 women, making 39.3% of the total workforce.

| Year    | % of women employees |
| ------- | -------------------- |
| 2021-22 | 39.6                 |
| 2022-23 | 39.4                 |

# Infosys’ climate commitments

- As a part of Infosys ESG Vision 2030, we have committed to maintaining carbon neutrality across scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions every year
- Signatory to the Climate Pledge, with the ultimate goal of a Net Zero planet by 2040
- Our goals are aligned to Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)

# Climate action strategy

We are working diligently towards this goal and have built our carbon neutral program on three pillars –

- Energy efficiency
- Renewable energy
- Carbon offsets

# Energy efficiency

To reduce emissions, we continue to push the envelope when it comes to creating efficient workplaces, by ensuring efficient design and operation of our buildings.

# Renewable energy

Renewable energy plays a crucial role in addressing the urgent challenges of climate change, energy security and sustainable development. Infosys was an early mover in renewable energy, adopting solar PV plants in our campuses way back in 2009 itself. Today, we have a total capacity of 60.2 MWp of solar PV across Infosys campuses, and a large solar park situated in Sira, about 140 km from Bengaluru.

# Carbon offsets

To offset emissions, our focus on high social impact carbon offset projects helps us to maintain carbon neutrality. The projects not only benefit the environment but also improve health, boost livelihoods, improve digital literacy, and help in creating rural jobs. Our unique offset program is certified to the highest level (Gold Standard) in terms of social impact, authenticity, and transparency.

# Water stewardship

At Infosys, we understand that water is essential for life, ecosystems and economic prosperity. As demand for water increases due to increasing population, urbanization and climate change, it is more crucial than ever to prioritize responsible water management. As a signatory to the CEO Water Mandate, we commit to enhancing our operational water conservation procedures and expanding our community outreach.

# Decarbonizing our supply chain

Mitigating climate change requires timely and decisive action from all stakeholders. To meet our ambitious targets on climate, we expect our suppliers to align with our goals and join climate action efforts.

# Lake rejuvenation

As part of our efforts to decarbonize our supply chain, we identified suppliers representing a large part of our capex spend and invested in training and capacity building for them. This effort included in-person training sessions covering topics including climate change, importance of disclosures, maintaining and improving data capture methodologies, and emission monitoring and calculation techniques applicable to the organization.

- Other measures like data-driven design, use of technology for design optimization, climate responsive architecture, use of systems adapted to local conditions, high-efficiency equipment and continuous monitoring at granular level for building performance parameters remotely.

# High-performance green buildings

Our green buildings are a testimony to our commitment to minimize impact on the environment even while building world-class facilities. We have about 29.6 mn sq.ft. of the highest level of green building certification but the differentiator is that we ensure the building performance is maintained through accurate monitoring, thereby making our buildings truly green.

# Green IT

# Data center efficiency

InfosysIT has taken up data center modernization as a strategic initiative. Density-optimized hyperscale platforms have been deployed to deliver high-density server virtualization and consolidation across the enterprise.

Capital Allocation Policy

Effective from financial year 2025, the Company expects to continue its policy of returning approximately 85% of the free cash flow cumulatively over a five-year period through a combination of semi-annual dividends and/or share buyback/special dividends subject to applicable laws and requisite approvals, if any. Under this policy, the Company expects to progressively increase its annual dividend per share (excluding special dividend if any). Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditure as per the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows prepared under IFRS. Dividend and buyback include applicable taxes.

During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company paid an interim dividend of ₹18 per share and announced a final dividend of ₹20 per share and special dividend of ₹8 per share, subject to shareholders’ approval in the ensuing Annual General Meeting (AGM). Including the final and special dividend declared above, the Company has returned approximately ₹88,400 crore, which is 85% of the cumulative free cash flow for fiscals 2020-2024 through dividends and buybacks, in line with the Capital Allocation Policy.

The Capital Allocation Policy is available on our website, at https://www.infosys.com/investors/corporate-governance/documents/capital-allocation-policy.pdf.

# Liquidity

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, investments and the cash flow that we generate from our operations. We continue to be debt-free and maintain sufficient cash to meet our strategic and operational requirements. We understand that liquidity in the Balance Sheet has to balance between earning adequate returns and the need to cover financial and business requirements. Liquidity enables us to be agile and ready for meeting unforeseen strategic and business needs and opportunities.

As of March 31, 2024, we had ₹43,866 crore in working capital on a standalone basis, and ₹50,638 crore on a consolidated basis. Consolidated cash and investments stand at ₹30,579 crore on a standalone basis and ₹39,005 crore on a consolidated basis as on March 31, 2024, as against ₹22,509 crore on a standalone basis, and ₹31,286 crore on a consolidated basis as on March 31, 2023.

Consolidated cash and investments, on both standalone and consolidated basis, include deposits with banks with high credit ratings by international and domestic credit rating agencies. As a result, liquidity risk of cash and cash equivalents is limited. Ratings are monitored periodically. Liquid assets also include investments in liquid mutual fund units, target maturity funds units, certificates of deposit (CDs), commercial paper (CP), quoted bonds and securities issued by government and quasi-government organizations, and non-convertible debentures.

CDs and CPs represent marketable securities of banks, NBFCs and eligible financial institutions for a specified time period with high credit rating given by domestic credit rating agencies. G-secs are highly liquid and marketable instruments issued across tenure, backed by the Government of India carrying a sovereign credit. Investments made in non-convertible debentures are issued by government-owned institutions and financial institutions with high credit rating. We invest after considering counterparty risks based on multiple criteria including Tier-I capital, capital adequacy ratio, credit rating, profitability, NPA levels and deposit base of banks and financial institutions.

The details of these investments are disclosed under the ‘non-current and current investments’ section in the Standalone and Consolidated financial statements in this Integrated Annual Report.

In accordance with the requirements, tables 3(a) and 3(b) include the perquisite value of stock incentives at the time of their exercise and do not include the value of the stock incentives at the time of grant.

The change in remuneration in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023 is primarily on account of change in perquisite value of stock incentives granted in previous years and exercised during the year. The change in perquisite value of stock incentives exercised during the year also includes the impact of number of units exercised.

# 4. Executive summary and web link(s) of Impact Assessment reports

The Company has been implementing various CSR projects for holistic community development and institution building to serve the enrichment and evolution of businesses and communities. For fiscal 2024, the Company has engaged an external agency to provide support and assistance for an independent review and impact assessment.

# Methodology:

In order to assess the impact of its CSR projects, a mixed-method approach was deployed which involved either one of or both the quantitative and qualitative research tools (as relevant) for primary data collection.

Annexure 7 – Conservation of energy, research and development, technology absorption, foreign exchange earnings and outgo

# Particulars pursuant to the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014

Our focused approach on energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon offset projects over the years resulted in the Company achieving carbon neutrality for five years in a row since fiscal 2020, across all emissions, as per PAS 2060:2014 standards. As we continue to remain carbon neutral for fiscal 2024, our efforts align with global commitments, thereby supporting the global response to the threat of climate change.

# Green buildings

In fiscal 2024, eight of our projects in Bengaluru, Mangaluru, Chennai, Coimbatore, Hyderabad and Nagpur were certified for high performance green buildings. These included Platinum certification from the US Green Building Council and Indian Green Building Council for new buildings, leased offices and interior retrofitted buildings that were re-certified. We now have around 29.6 million sq.ft of buildings with the highest level of green building certification.

# Resource conservation initiatives

Conservation of natural resources (energy and water) is important to maintain ecological balance and make them available for future generations and help protect the environment. Resource conservation initiatives at Infosys have been focused, continuous and imbibed in our operations and new infrastructure development. The introduction of highly efficient new buildings, major improvements in existing buildings, intelligent automation, water management plans, and waste treatment and management projects have significantly reduced our environmental impact. We have been able to expand our business while continuously reducing our resource intensity.

# Water management

Water conservation has been one of our focus areas and this has been enabled through a holistic approach to water management. The state-of-the-art sewage treatment plants with tertiary treatment capabilities enable zero discharge of wastewater from our campuses. We have implemented lake rejuvenation projects near our campuses, that will enhance water availability in the surroundings. We have ensured rooftop rainwater harvesting to use rainwater effectively in addition to recharge of groundwater aquifers through injection wells in many of our campuses.

# Waste management

Infosys follows the principles of Circular economy, based on Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Repurpose approach. We seek to uphold our ambition of ‘zero waste to landfill’ through active minimization combined with technological investments in recycling and streamlining systems and processes. We have achieved TRUE certification for zero waste, aimed at diversion of all non-hazardous solid waste from landfill at three of our campuses in India during the year. We have focused on diverting a portion of identified waste going for incineration to co-processing.

# Carbon offset

Unavoidable emissions are addressed through the carbon offset program. Infosys continues to identify projects that have a high social impact – improving the health and livelihoods of rural families and creating employment opportunities, and along the way, also generating carbon offsets for the Company.

# Renewable energy

With a total installed capacity of about 60.2 MW of solar PV, including roof-top and ground-mounted systems, we continue to pursue our ambition to transition to renewables for our operations. In addition to our own solar plants, we procure green power from third-party power producers and from DISCOMs through green tariff mechanism. The improved cookstove reduces smoke and firewood usage, and thus has a positive impact on health. The families benefit from the biogas project as they save on fuel costs and get natural gas.

# Health, safety and environment

The Health, Safety and Environmental Management System (HSEMS) at Infosys is an enunciation of our commitment to protecting the environment and providing a safe and healthy workplace for employees, contract workmen and visitors. Infosys is certified to ISO 14001:2015 (Environmental Management System) and ISO 45001:2018 (Occupational Health &#x26; Safety Management System) in line with our strategy. The HSEMS takes cognizance of interested parties and focuses on compliance with applicable laws in the regions where we operate. It includes well-defined policies and procedures and also strives to keep interested parties well-informed, trained and committed to our HSE process.

# Energy-efficient IT infrastructure

We have adopted a multi-pronged strategy to make our computer workload energy-efficient and environment-friendly. Some of the measures implemented are:

- Public cloud adoption: Majority of internal IT applications have been moved to public cloud infrastructure. Each of our employees has access to the cloud-based platform for collaboration such as messaging, presence, video and other requirements. Additionally, they also have cloud-based unified internet access and secure private access.
- Data center modernization: A strategic initiative launched by InfosysIT to modernize and future-proof the data center’s IT landscape continues to yield high rewards. Density-optimized hyperscale platforms have been deployed to enable high-density server virtualization and consolidation across the enterprise. Hyperscale platforms are open source-driven infrastructure innovations that enable agility at cloud scale as well as efficient pooling and utilization of resources. This initiative is delivering significant energy savings and reduces the total cost of ownership for the organization.

# Technology absorption

Live Enterprise@Infosys: An enterprise that senses, feels and responds in real-time – this was the theme of our transformation journey in the recent years. It had to be a mobile-first approach so that employees are connected to the organization wherever they are in the world and can access the organization’s resources to learn and contribute. The response has been phenomenal as over 5,50,000 users have tried the InfyMe mobile app with its 300+ features since its launch and more than 73,000 users have rated it 4.6/5 on Google PlayStore. With process bursting, we have seen many of our key processes become faster and more responsive and the Live Enterprise platform itself has been built on the latest open source stack. Following the overwhelming success in Infosys, we are also seeing interest of the Orbit platform (InfyMe version for our clients) as 13 clients have already been onboarded and many more are in discussion.

To enable this, our core backend infrastructure was transformed to host modern applications, using the scalability of the cloud. InfosysIT has invested in Data Center Infrastructure Management (DCIM) tool to gain an accurate overview of the entire IT and facility stack of the data center, which is the foundation for optimization initiatives. We provide around 1.8PB of storage capacity for employees, delivery units and internal requirements on all flash storage with fabric pool and storage grid technology. Data is marked hot and cold based on policy. Cold data is automatically moved to cheaper storage with larger capacity, resulting in data tiering and savings in terms of data center space, power consumption and cooling.

We expect the client spending and investments to move towards Artificial Intelligence (AI) and generative AI (gen AI) in the near term. These investments are expected to be crucial during this period of economic uncertainty. There is a new wave of dynamism in technologies. The industry is feeling the pressure to build AI strategies and stay ahead. We saw generative AI starting to reshape the industry in fiscal 2024. We continued to witness businesses attempting to reimagine their cost structures, increase business resilience and agility, personalize experiences for customers and employees, and launch new and disruptive products and services, aided by generative AI. With our leadership position in AI, we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of these market opportunities.

# 1. Revenue

The growth in our revenues in fiscal 2024 from fiscal 2023 is as follows:

| Particulars | Standalone |          |          | Consolidated |          |          |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------- | -------- | ------------ | -------- | -------- |
|             | 2024       | 2023     | % change | 2024         | 2023     | % change |
| Revenue     | 1,28,933   | 1,24,014 | 4.0      | 1,53,670     | 1,46,767 | 4.7      |

The increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue from software services, large deal wins, and increase in realization including pricing. Revenue growth in reported terms includes the impact of currency fluctuations. We, therefore, additionally report the revenue growth in constant currency terms, which represents the real growth in revenue, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations. We calculate constant currency growth by comparing current-period revenues in respective local currencies converted to INR using prior-period exchange rates and comparing the same to our prior-period reported revenues. Our revenues in reported currency terms for fiscal 2024 is US$ 18,562 million, a growth of 1.9%. Our revenues for fiscal 2024 in constant currency grew by 1.4%. We added 385 new customers (gross) during fiscal 2024 as compared to 458 new customers (gross) during fiscal 2023. On a consolidated basis, for the year ended March 31, 2024, approximately 97.5% were export revenues whereas 2.5% were domestic revenues, while for the year ended March 31, 2023, 97.4% were export revenues whereas 2.6% were domestic revenues. Refer to the ‘Segmental profitability’ section in this report for more details on the analysis of segment revenues.

# 2. Expenditure

# Cost of sales

The cost of efforts, comprising employee cost and cost of technical sub-contractors, has decreased as a percentage of revenue from 61.6% in fiscal 2023 to 60.2% in fiscal 2024 on a standalone basis, and from 58.0% in fiscal 2023 to 56.4% in fiscal 2024 on a consolidated basis. The cost of efforts has decreased mainly on account of decrease in sub-contractors cost and on account of improved utilization. Third-party items bought for service delivery to clients include software and hardware, which are integral to our overall service delivery to clients.

# Selling and marketing expenses

The selling and marketing expenses on standalone basis and consolidated basis have increased as a percentage of revenue during fiscal 2024 to 4.4% from 4.0% in fiscal 2023, and 4.5% during fiscal 2024 from 4.3% in fiscal 2023, respectively, mainly on account of increase in employee benefit costs and branding and marketing expenses.

# General and administration expenses

The general and administration expenses on standalone basis have reduced as a percentage of revenue during fiscal 2024 to 4.2% from 4.3% in fiscal 2023, mainly on account of a decrease in consulting and professional expenses and remained unchanged on consolidated basis during fiscal 2024 at 4.9%.

# 3. Other income and finance cost

Other income primarily includes income from investments, gain / loss on investments, foreign exchange gain / loss on forward and options contracts, foreign exchange gain / loss on translation of other assets and liabilities and interest on income tax refund. Other income for fiscal 2024 includes interest (pre-tax) on income tax refund of ₹1,933 crore on account of orders received under Sections 250 and 254 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, from the income tax authorities in India for certain assessment years. In fiscal 2024, the Company received ₹2,976 crore of dividend from our subsidiaries, which is reflected in the Standalone financial statement. Interest income in fiscal 2024 has increased as compared to fiscal 2023 primarily due to a increase in yield on investments. We use foreign exchange forward and options contracts to hedge our exposure against movements in foreign exchange rates. Finance cost is on account of leases. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of these leases.

We have provided for our tax liability both in India and overseas. The applicable Indian corporate statutory tax rate for both the years ended March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2023 is 34.94%.

Effective tax rate is generally influenced by various factors, including differential tax rates, non-deductible expenses, exempt non-operating income, overseas taxes, benefits from SEZ units, tax reversals and provisions pertaining to prior periods primarily on account of adjudication of certain disputed matters, filing of tax return and completion of assessments, across various jurisdictions.

Provision for tax includes net tax reversal of ₹38 crore on account of orders received under Sections 250 and 254 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, from the income tax authorities in detail in Note 2.26 to the Consolidated financial statement in this Integrated Annual Report.

# 6. Liquidity

Our principal source of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and cash flow that we generate from operations. We have no outstanding borrowings. We believe our working capital is sufficient for our requirements.

Our growth has been financed largely through cash generated from operations.




# Management’s discussion and analysis

Our cash flows are robust. Our operating cash flows have increased in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023 mainly on account of increase in net profit adjusted for non-cash items partially offset by higher income tax payments. Consolidated cash and investments of ₹39,005 crore comprise cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current investments excluding investments in equity and preference shares and others.

We also have a strong governance mechanism in the form of GRB (Grievance Redressal Body) to define, interpret and implement Company’s policy on anti-harassment and anti-discrimination at workplace. GRB consists of external members, internal senior members, and the Investigative Council. Here, we follow a gender-neutral approach in redressal of all such complaints. Complaints are taken up for a formal redressal process in line.

# Our corporate governance philosophy

Our corporate governance is a reflection of our value system, encompassing our culture, policies, and relationships with our stakeholders. Integrity and transparency are key to our corporate governance practices and performance, and ensure that we gain and retain the trust of our stakeholders at all times. Corporate governance is an ethically-driven business process that is committed to values aimed at enhancing an organization’s capacity to create wealth. This is ensured by taking ethical business decisions and conducting business with a firm commitment to values, while meeting stakeholders’ expectations. At Infosys (“the Company”), it is imperative that our Company affairs are managed in a fair and transparent manner. This is vital to gain and retain the trust of our stakeholders. We are committed to defining, following and practicing the highest level of corporate governance across all our business functions.

Our Company has been a leader in adopting internationally-recognized corporate governance guidelines and has set the highest standards in abiding by them.

# Corporate governance guidelines

Strong corporate governance is the bedrock of our sustained performance and has helped us gain the trust and respect of all our stakeholders. The enhancement of these corporate governance standards, through periodic evaluation and change, is one of the most important aspects of ensuring value creation for our stakeholders.

Our corporate governance follows the guidelines established by the Board of the Company. These guidelines provide a structure within which directors and the Management can effectively pursue the Company’s objectives for the benefit of its stakeholders. These are framed in conjunction with the Company’s Memorandum &#x26; Articles of Association, the charters of the committees of the Board and applicable laws / regulations / guidelines in force in India, the US and other jurisdictions, as applicable.

# Independent directors

We abide by the definitions of an independent director, as laid down under the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) and the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“the Listing Regulations”), as amended, along with the definitions laid down in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listed company manual, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and US securities laws by virtue of our listing on the NYSE in the US. Based on the disclosures received from all independent directors and in the opinion of the Board, the independent directors fulfil the conditions specified in the Act, the Listing Regulations, NYSE listing manual and are independent of the Management.

# Board Meetings

Scheduling and selection of agenda items for Board meetings. The tentative dates of Board meetings for the next fiscal are decided in advance and published in the Integrated Annual Report. The Chairman and the Company Secretary, in consultation with the CEO &#x26; MD, propose the agenda for each meeting, along with explanatory notes, and distribute these in advance to the directors. Every Board member can suggest the inclusion of additional items in the agenda.

The Board meets at least once a quarter to review the quarterly results and other items on the agenda. Additional meetings are held when necessary. Independent directors are expected to attend at least four quarterly Board meetings and the Annual General Meeting (AGM). However, with the Board being represented by independent directors from various parts of the world, it may not be possible for all of them to be physically present at all meetings. Hence, we provide video/teleconferencing facilities to enable their participation.

The Board members are expected to rigorously prepare for, attend and participate in Board and applicable committee meetings. Each member is expected to ensure their other commitments do not materially interfere with their responsibilities towards the Company.

# Meeting of Independent Directors

For the Board to exercise free and fair judgment in all matters related to the functioning of the Company as well as the Board, it is important for the independent directors to have meetings without the presence of the executive management. Schedule IV of the Companies Act, 2013 and the Rules thereunder mandate that the independent directors of the Company shall hold at least one meeting in a financial year, without the attendance of non-independent directors and members of the Management. Even before the Companies Act, 2013 came into effect, our Board’s process mandated periodic meetings attended exclusively by the independent directors.

During the year, the independent directors met four times. At such meetings, the independent directors discuss, among other matters, the performance of the Company and risks faced by it, the flow of information to the Board, competition, strategy, leadership strengths and weaknesses, governance, compliance, Board movements, succession planning, human resources matters and the performance of the executive members of the Board, and the Chairman.

The Company has separated the roles of Chairman and the CEO &#x26; MD to create a more balanced governance structure. The Chairman leads the Board and is responsible for fostering and promoting the integrity of the Board while nurturing a culture in which the Board works harmoniously for the long-term benefit of the Company and all its stakeholders.

He is responsible for overseeing matters pertaining to governance, including the organization, composition and effectiveness of the Board and its committees, and the performance of individual directors.

The Chairman actively works with the Nomination and Remuneration Committee to plan the composition of the Board and Board committees, induct directors to the Board, plan for director succession, participate effectively in the Board evaluation process and meet with individual directors to provide constructive feedback and advice.

# CEO &#x26; MD

The CEO &#x26; MD is responsible for executing corporate strategy in consultation with the Board, as well as for brand equity, planning, building external contacts and all matters related to the management of the Company. He is responsible for achieving annual and long-term business targets. The CEO &#x26; MD also monitors the external and internal competitive landscape, and new industry developments and standards, identifies opportunities for expansion and acquisition, and builds relationships with customers and markets to enhance shareholder value and implementing the organization’s vision, mission, and overall direction.

The CEO &#x26; MD acts as a link between the Board and the Management and is also responsible for leading and evaluating the work of other executive leaders.

# Lead Independent Director

The lead independent director was appointed by the Board to ensure robust independent leadership of the Board. The general authority and responsibilities of the lead independent director are decided by the group of independent directors. The lead independent director also performs additional duties as determined by the Board.

The lead independent director provides leadership to the independent directors, liaises on behalf of the independent directors and ensures the Board’s effectiveness in maintaining high-quality governance of the organization and effective functioning of the Board.

Fairness and excellence

# Fairness and excellence

Two of the core values of our C-LIFE, fairness and excellence are evident in the workings of the Board, its evaluation and the compensation paid to the directors and the executive leadership.

# Board member evaluation

One of the key functions of the Board is to monitor and review the Board evaluation framework. The Board works with the Nomination and Remuneration Committee to lay down the evaluation criteria for the performance of the Chairman, the Board, Board committees, and executive / non-executive / independent directors through peer evaluation, excluding the director being evaluated.

Independent directors have three key roles – governance, control and guidance. Some performance indicators, based on which the independent directors are evaluated, include:

- The ability to contribute to and monitor our corporate governance practices
- The ability to contribute by introducing international best practices to address business challenges and risks
- Active participation in long-term strategic planning
- Commitment to the fulfilment of a director’s obligations and fiduciary responsibilities; these include participation in Board and committee meetings.

To improve the effectiveness of the Board and its committees, as well as that of each individual director, a formal and rigorous Board review is internally undertaken on an annual basis. The Board had engaged Egon Zehnder, a leadership advisory firm on board matters, to conduct the Board evaluation for fiscal 2024. The evaluation process focused on Board dynamics, softer aspects, committee effectiveness and information flow to the Board or its committees, among other matters. The methodology included various techniques such as questionnaires, one-on-one discussions, etc. The recommendations were discussed with the Board and individual feedback was provided. Progress on recommendations from last year and the current year’s recommendations were discussed. The aspects of succession planning and committee composition were also considered. The Board evaluation process was completed during fiscal 2024.

Further, the evaluation process was based on the affirmation received from the independent directors that they met the independence criteria as required under the Companies Act 2013, the Listing Regulations and the NYSE listing manual.

# Board and executive leadership compensation

# Executive leadership compensation

Our executive compensation programs encourage reward for performance. A significant portion of the executives’ total rewards is tied to the delivery of long-term corporate performance goals to align with the interests of the shareholders. As required under the Listing Regulations, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee recommends to the Board the payment of remuneration to the senior management. The Nomination and Remuneration Policy of the Company is available on our website, at Nomination and Remuneration Policy.

# Non-executive and non-independent chairman’s compensation

Nandan M. Nilekani, Chairman, voluntarily chose not to receive any remuneration for his services rendered to the Company.

# Independent directors’ compensation

The compensation payable to the independent directors is limited to a fixed amount per year as determined and approved by the Board, the sum of which does not exceed 1% of net profit for the year, calculated as per the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013. The Board reviews the performance of independent directors on an annual basis.

The Board, while deciding the basis for determining the compensation of the independent directors, takes various things into consideration. These include global board compensation benchmarking, participation of individual directors in Board and committee meetings, other responsibilities, such as membership or chairmanship of committees, time spent in carrying out other duties, roles and functions as prescribed in Schedule IV of the Act, Listing Regulations and such other factors as the Board deems fit.

Shareholders at the 34ᵗʰ AGM held on June 22, 2015 approved a sum not exceeding 1% of the net profit of the Company per annum, calculated in accordance with the provisions of Section 198 of the Companies Act, 2013, to be paid and distributed among some or all of the non-executive directors of the Company.

| Lead Independent Director           |      | 0.25        | 30,000   |

Notes: 1 US$ = `83.41 as on March 31, 2024. The payment is subject to deduction of tax at source (TDS) as required by applicable tax laws.

(1) The Company normally has five regular Board meetings in a year. Independent directors are expected to attend at least four quarterly Board meetings and the AGM.

(2) For directors based overseas, the travel fee shown is per Board meeting. This is based on the fact that additional travel time of two days will have to be accommodated for independent directors to attend Board meetings in India.

(3) For directors based overseas, incidental fees shown is per Board meeting. This fee is paid to independent directors for expenses incurred during their travel to attend Board meetings in India.

The Board believes that the above compensation structure is commensurate with global best practices in terms of remunerating non-executive / independent directors of a company of similar size, and adequately compensates for the time and contribution made by our non-executive / independent directors.

# Indemnification agreements

We have also entered into agreements to indemnify our directors and officers for claims brought against them to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. These agreements, among other things, indemnify our directors and officers for certain expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any such person in any action or proceedings, including any action by or in the right of the Company, arising out of such persons’ services as our director or officer, expenses in relation to public relations consultation, if required.

# Materially significant related party transactions

There have been no materially significant related party transactions that may have potential conflict with the interests of listed entity at large as provided in the Related Party Transactions Policy, which is available on our website, at https://www.infosys.com/investors/corporate-governance/Documents/related-party-transaction-policy.pdf.

# Integrity and transparency &#x26; Relationship with stakeholders

Our Company upholds integrity and transparency in all transactions and communications to stakeholders. Our stakeholders are our partners in the path to sustained value creation and therefore, our relationship with stakeholders and clear communication with them is at the center of all disclosures and reports.

# Corporate

Infosys was incorporated in Pune, in 1981, as Infosys Consultants Private Limited, a private limited company under the Companies Act, 1956. In 1983, the corporate headquarters were relocated to Bengaluru. The name of the Company was changed to Infosys Technologies Private Limited in April 1992 and to Infosys Technologies Limited in June 1992, when the Company became a public limited company. We made an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in February 1993 and were listed on stock exchanges in India in June 1993. Trading opened at ₹145 per share, compared to the IPO price of ₹95 per share. In October 1994, we made a private placement of 5,50,000 shares at ₹450 each to Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), Financial Institutions (FIs) and body corporates. On March 11, 1999, Infosys listed on NASDAQ, becoming the first Indian company to do so. We issued 20,70,000 American Depositary Shares (ADSs) (equivalent to 10,35,000 equity shares of par value ₹10 each) at US$34 per ADS under the ADS Program, and these ADSs were listed on the NASDAQ National Market.

The share data mentioned before is unadjusted for stock split and bonus shares. In July 2003, June 2005 and November 2006, we issued secondary-sponsored American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) of US$294 million, US$1.1 billion and US$1.6 billion, respectively. On March 11, 2024, Infosys marked 25 years of listing in the US.

During fiscal 2012, the name of the Company was changed from Infosys Technologies Limited to Infosys Limited to mark the transition from being a technology services provider to a business transformation partner to our clients. During fiscal 2013, we delisted our ADSs from NASDAQ, and listed them in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Euronext London and Euronext Paris. During fiscal 2019, the Company voluntarily delisted from Euronext London and Paris due to low trading volume. Infosys equity shares and ADSs are listed on NSE and BSE in India and in NYSE, respectively, under the symbol “INFY”. Indian IT services sector is credited as having put India on the global map over two decades ago, with Infosys widely seen as being the ‘posterchild’ of the sector.

Note: The above graph depicts the increase in the number of Infosys shares as a result of the Company’s bonus issues over the years and a stock split in 2000 in the ratio of 2:1. For example, if the investor / shareholder held one share in 1986 prior to the bonus issue and continued to hold it, he would have 16,384 shares today owing to the bonus share issues and stock split.

Shareholders may contact the RTA at einward.ris@kfintech.com and also refer details at https://www.infosys.com/investors/shareholder-services/investors-service.html.

The Stakeholders Relationship Committee meets as often as required to resolve shareholder grievances. We attended to most of the investors’ grievances and postal / electronic communications within a period of seven days from the date of receipt of such grievances. The exceptions have been for cases constrained by disputes or legal impediments.

Shareholders may note that the share transfers, dividend payments and all other investor-related activities are attended to and processed at the office of the Company’s RTA.

# Risk management report

“Risks related to the geo-political changes, uncertainties in the economy, supply chain constraints, talent availability, technology disruption and cybersecurity have impacted businesses across the world during the fiscal year. Our enterprise risk management processes were instrumental in keeping the Company focused on our most important priorities toward all our stakeholders.”

Deepak Bhalla
EVP – Chief Risk Officer

Note: The risk-related information outlined in this section may not be exhaustive. The discussion may contain statements that are forward-looking in nature. Our business is subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements. If any of the risks materializes, our business, financial conditions or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Our business, operating results, financial performance, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. Readers are advised to refer to the detailed discussion of risk factors and related disclosures in our regulatory filings and exercise their own judgment in assessing risks associated with the Company.

Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function enables the achievement of the Company’s strategic objectives by identifying, analyzing, assessing, mitigating, monitoring and governing any risk or potential threat to these objectives. While this is the key driver, our values, culture and commitment to stakeholders – employees, customers, investors, regulatory bodies, partners and the community around us – are the foundation for our ERM framework. The systematic and proactive identification of risks, and mitigation thereof, enables our organization to boost performance with effective and timely decision-making. Strategic decisions are taken after careful consideration of primary risks, secondary risks, consequential risks and residual risks. The ERM function also enables effective resource allocation through structured qualitative and quantitative risk impact assessment and prioritization based on our risk appetite. Our ERM framework also enables the identification of underlying opportunities during risk assessment, which are then further evaluated and actionized by the business. Our ERM framework encompasses all of the Company’s risks – strategy and strategy execution; operational; and legal and compliance risks. Any of these categories can have internal or external dimensions. Hence, appropriate risk indicators are used to identify these risks proactively. We take cognizance of risks faced by our key stakeholders and their cumulative impact while framing our risk responses.

# Emerging risks

Our ERM framework has defined a process to identify, assess, plan, and monitor risks emerging from internal and external environments, which enable the Company to build and maintain resilience in uncertain times. The process includes horizon scanning, and SWOT analysis, which cover political, economic, social, technology, legal and environmental aspects. The emerging risks are monitored constantly and discussed in the risk councils and with the Risk Management Committee (RMC) of the Board on periodic basis.

# Strategy and strategy execution

The risks arising out of the choices we have made in defining our strategy and the risks to the successful execution of our strategy are covered in this category. For example, risks inherent to our industry and our competitiveness are analyzed and mitigated through strategic choices of target markets, our market offerings, business model and talent base.

# Operational

The risks affecting our policies, procedures, people and systems, thereby impacting service delivery or operations, or compromising our core values or business practices are covered in this category. For example, risks such as inefficiencies in internal processes, human rights, business activity disruptions due to natural calamities, climate change events, human conflicts, system failures and cybersecurity attacks.

# Legal and compliance

The risks arising out of threats posed to our financial, organizational, or reputational standing resulting from litigations, non-conformance with laws, regulatory or geo-political developments, codes of conduct and contractual compliances are covered in this category.

# Integrated Enterprise Risk Management Framework

We have adopted an integrated ERM framework that is implemented across the organization by the risk management office. Our ERM framework is developed by incorporating the best practices based on COSO and ISO 31000 and then tailored to suit our unique business requirements.

# Salient features of our Enterprise Risk Management program

Our ERM program adopts unique methods to identify risks, evaluate potential impact and promote risk awareness across the organization.

# Secondary, consequential and residual risks

Secondary risks are threats that could impede the mitigation of primary risks. Consequential risks are the unintended consequences of primary mitigation, and residual risks are those risks that are left over after mitigation.

# Aggregation and accumulation

Exposure for same risks are aggregated as it goes up the hierarchy. This provides enterprise-wide view to the leadership. Cumulated risk view is also provided to understand total exposure arising out of all risks at a unit level.

# Process risk frameworks

Process-specific risk frameworks have been developed for decision-making, for example, frameworks for customer risk, vendor risk, contractual liability, contractual weighted risk and credit risk.

# Intelligent risk analytics

Internal and external risk and performance indicators, and loss incidents are used in real time to identify, analyze and assess potential issues that could negatively impact strategic goals.

# RΙSC360 : iGRC

RΙSC360 is the Company’s Governance, Risk management and Compliance (GRC) program that combines three lines of defense under one umbrella. This enables risk-based decision-making and auditing. The Company has implemented a technology platform, iGRC, to provide a consolidated view of risks to strategic goals.

# Risk culture

Our risk culture encourages open and upward communication. Coupled with our belief systems and core values, this drives behavior, guides daily activities and decision-making throughout the organization. We encourage sharing of knowledge and best practices, continuous process improvement and a strong commitment to ethics and integrity.

Cyber risks, being one of the key risks, is managed through multi-layered controls with a defense-in-depth approach starting from the cybersecurity strategy, supplemented by policies, processes and controls (preventive, detective, and corrective). Our strategy is focussed on four areas: transparency and experience; continual improvement and compliance; cyber resilience; and building and maintaining a positive cybersecurity culture within the organization. A high-level working group, the enterprise Information Security Council (ISC), has been established, which is responsible for governing and overseeing the Information Security Management System (ISMS) at Infosys. ISC focuses on establishing, directing, monitoring, and executing the information security program with representation from various departments and business units at Infosys and reports to the Operational Risk Council highlighting key risks to the executive leadership.

# McCamish cybersecurity incident

Infosys McCamish Systems (“McCamish”) engaged cybersecurity and other specialists to assist in its investigation of and response to its November 2023 cybersecurity incident and remediation and restoration of impacted applications and systems. By December 31, 2023, McCamish, with external specialists’ assistance, substantially remediated and restored the affected applications and systems. Actions taken by McCamish also included investigative analysis conducted by a third-party cybersecurity firm to determine, among other things, whether and the extent to which data was subject to unauthorized access or exfiltration and engaging a third-party eDiscovery vendor in assessing the extent and nature of such data.

McCamish in coordination with its third-party eDiscovery vendor has identified up to approximately 6.5 million individuals whose information was subject to unauthorized access and exfiltration in the November 2023 cybersecurity incident. The information associated with each individual varies, but the data as a whole includes information such as email and mailing addresses, phone numbers, birth dates, social security numbers and other identification numbers, usernames, passwords, financial and customer account numbers, policy numbers, salaries and personal medical information. However, not all of these individuals had all of this information accessed and exfiltrated. McCamish also identified corporate customers whose business data was subject to unauthorized access and exfiltration. McCamish has notified its impacted customers and intends to work with these customers to support their respective reporting obligations, as appropriate. McCamish’s review process is ongoing.

Infosys has undertaken a review of its cybersecurity posture and threat landscape to build further fortification and to strengthen its cyber defense capabilities. As an organization, we continue to review and strengthen our cybersecurity processes and controls across our entire network in line with industry best practices.

# Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report

Infosys has always placed sustainability at the heart of its business approach. Our ability to fulfill and exceed our responsibilities to our stakeholders is a testament to our commitment. We have balanced our business success with an unwavering focus on exemplary governance and responsiveness to the needs of the environment and society. As an early proponent of responsible business, we readily embraced our commitment to integrate Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors into our operations. We adopted the GRI Framework in 2008 and in fiscal 2013, we were among the first companies to publish the Business Responsibility Report (BRR).

Our BRSR follows the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC) principles on the social, environmental and economic responsibilities of business. Our BRSR includes our responses to questions about our practices and performance on key principles defined by Regulation 34(2)(f) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015 as amended from time to time, which cover topics across the ESG dimensions.

# 10. Health and safety management system:

# 10a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes / No). If yes, the coverage of such system?

Yes. Infosys recognizes and accords highest priority to safety and well-being of its employees and other relevant parties. Our HSE Policy enunciates our philosophy and commitment towards the management of key HSE aspects. In line with our strategy, our HSEMS at all Indian locations is certified to ISO 45001:2018 standard. At overseas locations, we have implemented processes based on legal requirements / internal benchmarks and have also included them in the internal audits cycle. We have established numerous interventions to address occupational health-related topics such as emotional well-being, mental health, ergonomics, safety, lifestyle diseases and more. Well-equipped occupational health centers are available at all our campuses in India. During the year, doctors and physiotherapists have helped employees and their families through virtual consultations leveraging our telemedicine portal. More details on Occupational Health and Safety are available on our website at https://www.infosys.com/about/corporate-responsibility/social/employee-wellbeing/occupational-health-safety.html.

# 10b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity?

We proactively identify occupational health and safety risks, for all existing / new / modified activities, processes, products or services, and regulatory changes, including routine and non-routine activities. Risk assessment includes quarterly evaluation of incidents that have occurred. Hazardous conditions, if any, are identified and prioritized for elimination and control. Once the identified hierarchy of controls is implemented, the risk assessment is revisited to assess the residual risks. As Infosys is an IT / ITES company, there are no product risks, but there are those related to the provision of services like ergonomics at work and those associated with the operation of utilities and employees’ commute. Participation and consultation with relevant personnel involved in the activities is ensured during the risk assessments. Risks are also assessed before and post the development of new buildings. Experience from previous projects and current operations is also considered. We continually monitor our construction sites where infrastructure is being established. More details on Occupational Health and Safety are available on our website at https://www.infosys.com/about/corporate-responsibility/social/employee-wellbeing/occupational-health-safety.html.

# 12. Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.

Infosys acknowledges that Occupational Health and Safety (OH&#x26;S) is one of the key aspects of sustainable business practices. OH&#x26;S policies, processes, and practices at Infosys promote physical, mental, and social well-being of employees in the workplace. The robust Health and Safety Management system at Infosys has earned us the certification of ISO 45001:2018 for all Indian locations, including Infosys Limited and its subsidiaries, in line with our HSE strategy.

The Company has the following measures to ensure a safe and healthy workplace:

1. Incident management: Incidents which include near misses / potential hazards / accidents are reported through internal applications, supervisors, or mails and root causes of incidents are identified, analyzed and appropriate corrective actions are taken to avoid recurrence or occurrence of incidents leading to injuries / losses.
2. OH&#x26;S Committee: Both employees and contract workers are a part of the Infosys OH&#x26;S Committee which helps in ensuring their active participation and consultation.
3. Training and awareness: Training includes awareness building, mock drills, classroom sessions and periodic demonstrations. HSEMS training is a part of our employee induction program. To enable continuous learning, a HSE awareness module is available on Lex, our internal learning platform. Job-specific and generic trainings are conducted for contractual staff during induction and later through refresher trainings.
4. Safety interventions: We have always focused on building a culture of safety at Infosys. The safety systems in place include work permits, trainings, Lock Out Tag Out (LOTO), safety inspections, audits, operational controls, and monitoring. Policies have been established focusing on specific areas such as women’s safety, lone working, transport, travel, construction, amongst others.
5. Medical services: We have set up first aid centers on our campuses in India. Some of the first aid facilities are operational round the clock. Our telemedicine portal continues to operate and allows employees to consult the doctors at our occupational health centers in India online. Ambulance services are available at all our locations in India round the clock.
6. Health Risk Assessment: HRA is carried out annually based on inputs from the OHC. Being an IT / ITES company, the prevalent risks include ergonomics, Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs), emotional well-being, etc., associated with workplace, operation of utilities, and commute. Numerous initiatives, interventions, engagement virtual sessions, and process controls are in place to address these risks.
7. Programs on ergonomics: These include on-site physiotherapy centres, interventions by ergonomic experts and providing ergonomic infrastructure.
8. Physical and emotional well-being: At our locations in India, we have dietitians to provide counseling and guidance. We have also set up state-of-the-art gyms to train physical and mental fitness.
9. Programs for mothers: Pregna Care, a professional health care program is designed especially for expectant mothers and aims at providing maximum comfort to the mother.
10. Working environment: We also focus on improving the work environment by monitoring indoor air quality, lux and noise levels and promoting the use of green seal chemicals.

# 8. Mechanism to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases

Infosys’ non-retaliation policy is an embodiment of our values and a cornerstone of our Code. Infosys commits to protect the complainant and ensures that they are not retaliated against because of any report that they raise in good faith. Infosys does not tolerate any form of retaliation (whether by a manager, co-worker or otherwise) against an individual because he or she made a good faith report of an integrity concern. This protection also extends to anyone who assists with or cooperates in an investigation or reports of an integrity concern or question. We support those who support our values.

(1) Scope 1 emissions cover all owned offices (India, US and China) and leased offices in India; Leased space in overseas locations will not be considered as it is falls in de-minimus for diesel / natural gas consumption.

(2) Scope 2 includes India and overseas locations.

# 8. Does the entity have any project related to reducing greenhouse gas emission? If yes, provide details.

Infosys has been carbon neutral since fiscal 2020 across Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Our approach to carbon neutrality is based on reducing and avoiding emissions through energy efficiency and renewable energy. Energy efficiency is achieved through super-efficient new buildings, industry-leading Energy Performance Index (EPI) &#x3C;70 kWh/m2-yr, real-time monitoring and optimization of building operations through smart building systems, and retrofits in existing buildings. Infosys has implemented several retrofit projects (across air conditioning, lighting, and UPS systems) in the past and achieved a connected electrical load reduction of 36 MW across campuses in India. In fiscal 2024, we have undertaken a retrofit project to replace direct FCU units with chilled water units of air conditioning, which saved 1.1 lakh kWh and reduced emissions by 80.84 tCO2e. To achieve our goal of transitioning to clean energy, we have installed 60.2 MWp of solar PV capacity.

# Waste Management Practices

The 5R principle –’ Reduce, Reuse, Refurbish, Repurpose and Recycle’ – forms the foundation of Infosys’ waste management strategy. Through our efforts, we turn waste into resources and thus support a circular economy. Infosys has adopted a comprehensive waste management policy that emphasizes the collection, sorting and disposal of waste. Waste management practices at Infosys include source segregation, secondary segregation, effective waste processing and collection, recycling and efficient disposal of all waste in accordance with relevant laws. This helps reduce negative impacts on the environment.

# Business Continuity and Disaster Management Plan

Infosys has a Business Continuity Management System (BCMS) called Phoenix, certified by ISO 22301:2019 Security and Resilience – Business Continuity Management Standard. This program is designed to ensure seamless continuity of business and the utmost safety of employees and organization assets while continuously meeting client expectations. The BCMS program provides a robust framework for planning, establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining, and continually improving business continuity measures across Infosys and its subsidiaries as per the global BCMS strategy. Infosys has a business continuity and disaster recovery plan called the Phoenix plan at the corporate level, and comprehensive business continuity plans are created at three operational levels covering business functions, locations, and accounts. Integrated into our Enterprise Risk Management Framework, the BCMS plans guide our typical response to events, such as catastrophes and natural or human-made disasters, which could disrupt or severely constrain our operations. This covers various crisis scenarios as part of detailed risk assessments for functions, locations, and accounts, which are documented with mitigation plans along with controls put in place. The management system has been continuously validated across levels through tests and exercises, and various incidents have been successfully tackled without any significant business continuity or employee safety impacts. An efficient business continuity management policy has enabled us to maintain the status quo during disasters.

Independent Auditor’s Report

# To The Members Of Infosys Limited

# Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements

# Opinion

We have audited the accompanying Standalone Financial Statements of INFOSYS LIMITED (the “Company”), which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2024, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended on that date and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as the “Standalone Financial Statements”).

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Standalone Financial Statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under Section 133 of the Act, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2024 and its profit, total comprehensive income, changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“SA”s) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

Standalone Financial Statements

# Key Audit Matter

| Sr. No. | Key Audit Matter    |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| 1       | Revenue recognition |

The Company’s contracts with customers include contracts with multiple products and services. The Company derives revenues from IT services comprising software development and related services, maintenance, consulting and package implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Company’s core and digital offerings and business process management services. The Company assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables involves significant judgment.

In certain integrated services arrangements, contracts with customers include subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Company is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Company first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods or service before it is transferred to the customer. The Company considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or service, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the products or service and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.

Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on (1) a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage-of-completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Company’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.

As certain contracts with customers involve management’s judgment in (1) identifying distinct performance obligations, (2) determining whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (3) whether fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage-of-completion method, revenue recognition from these judgments were identified as a key audit matter and required a higher extent of audit effort. Refer to Notes 1.4 and 2.18 to the Standalone Financial Statements.

# Auditor’s Response

# Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following:

Our audit procedures related to the (1) identification of distinct performance obligations, (2) determination of whether the Company is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage-of-completion method included the following, among others:

- We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the (a) identification of distinct performance obligations, (b) determination of whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (c) determination of whether fixed-price maintenance revenue for certain contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage-of-completion method.
- We selected a sample of contracts with customers and performed the following procedures:
- Obtained and read contract documents for each selection, including master service agreements, and other documents that were part of the agreement.
- Identified significant terms and deliverables in the contract to assess management’s conclusions regarding the (i) identification of distinct performance obligations (ii) whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (iii) whether fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage-of-completion method.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24

# 2. Key Audit Matter

# Revenue recognition – Fixed-price contracts using the percentage-of-completion method

Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either (1) on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage-of-completion method when the pattern of benefits from services rendered to the customer and the Company’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.

Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Company to determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgment and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.

We identified the estimate of total efforts or costs to complete fixed-price contracts measured using the percentage-of-completion method as a key audit matter as the estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgment and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. This estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts or costs incurred to-date and estimates of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations over the term of the contracts.

This required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence and a higher extent of audit effort to evaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts.

Refer to Notes 1.4 and 2.18 to the Standalone Financial Statements.

# Auditor’s Response

Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following:

Our audit procedures related to estimates of total expected costs or efforts to complete for fixed-price contracts included the following, among others:

- We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to (1) recording of efforts or costs incurred and estimation of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations and (2) access and application controls pertaining to time recording, allocation and budgeting systems, which prevents unauthorised changes to recording of efforts incurred.
- We selected a sample of fixed-price contracts with customers measured using the percentage-of-completion method and performed the following:
- Evaluated management’s ability to reasonably estimate the progress towards satisfying the performance obligation by comparing actual efforts or costs incurred to prior year estimates of efforts or costs budgeted for performance obligations that have been fulfilled.
- Compared efforts or costs incurred with Company’s estimate of efforts or costs incurred to date to identify significant variations and evaluate whether those variations have been considered appropriately in estimating the remaining costs or efforts to complete the contract.
- Tested the estimate for consistency with the status of delivery of milestones and customer acceptances and sign off from customers to identify possible delays in achieving milestones, which require changes in estimated costs or efforts to complete the remaining performance obligations.

Standalone Financial Statements

# Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board’s Report, including Annexures to Board’s Report, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, Corporate Governance and Shareholder’s Information, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, Standalone Financial Statements and our Auditor’s Report thereon.

Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements does not cover the other information and, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Standalone Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, including Other Comprehensive Income, Changes in Equity and Cash Flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including Ind AS specified under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, management and Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Company’s Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor’s Report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our Auditor’s Report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our Auditor’s Report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

# Report on the Standalone Financial Statements

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Standalone Financial Statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal financial controls that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our Auditor’s Report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

1. We have sought and obtained all the information and explanations, which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary for the purposes of our audit.

In our opinion, the Company is in compliance with Section 177 and 188 of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to applicable transactions with the related parties and the details of related party transactions have been disclosed in the Standalone Financial Statements as required by the applicable accounting standards.

xiv. (a) In our opinion, the Company has an adequate internal audit system commensurate with the size and the nature of its business.

(b) We have considered the internal audit reports for the year under audit, issued to the Company during the year and till date, in determining the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures.

xv. In our opinion, during the year the Company has not entered into any non-cash transactions with its Directors or persons connected with its directors and hence provisions of Section 192 of the Companies Act, 2013 are not applicable.

xvi. (a) In our opinion, the Company is not required to be registered under Section 45-IA of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. Hence, reporting under clause 3(xvi)(a), (b) and (c) of the Order is not applicable.

(b) In our opinion, there is no core investment Company within the Group (as defined in the Core Investment Companies (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2016) and accordingly reporting under clause 3(xvi)(d) of the Order is not applicable.

xvii. The Company has not incurred cash losses during the financial year covered by our audit and the immediately preceding financial year.

xviii. There has been no resignation of the statutory auditors of the Company during the year.

xix. On the basis of the financial ratios, ageing and expected dates of realisation of financial assets and payment of financial liabilities, other information accompanying the financial statements and our knowledge of the Board of Directors and Management plans and based on our examination of the evidence supporting the assumptions, nothing has come to our attention, which causes us to believe that any material uncertainty exists as on the date of the audit report indicating that Company is not capable of meeting its liabilities existing at the date of balance sheet as and when they fall due within a period of one year from the balance sheet date. We, however, state that this is not an assurance as to the future viability of the Company. We further state that our reporting is based on the facts up to the date of the audit report and we neither give any guarantee nor any assurance that all liabilities falling due within a period of one year from the balance sheet date, will get discharged by the Company as and when they fall due.

xx. (a) There are no unspent amounts towards Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) on other than ongoing projects requiring a transfer to a Fund specified in Schedule VII to the Companies Act, 2013 in compliance with second proviso to sub-section (5) of Section 135 of the said Act. Accordingly, reporting under clause 3(xx)(a) of the Order is not applicable for the year.

(b) In respect of ongoing projects, the Company has transferred unspent CSR amount as at the end of the previous financial year, to a Special account within a period of 30 days from the end of the said financial year in compliance with the provision of Section 135(6) of the Companies Act, 2013. In respect of ongoing projects, the Company has not transferred the unspent CSR amount as at the Balance Sheet date out of the amounts that was required to be spent during the year, to a Special Account in compliance with the provision of sub-section(6) of Section 135 of the said Act till the date of our report since the time period for such transfer, i.e., 30 days from the end of the financial year has not elapsed till the date of our report.

# Standalone Financial Statements

Statement of Cash Flows

# Accounting policy

Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit for the year is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated. The Company considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash to be cash equivalents.

Overview and Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements

# 1. Overview

financial statements have been disclosed in Note no. 1.4. Accounting estimates could change from period to period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Appropriate changes in estimates are made as management becomes aware of changes in circumstances surrounding the estimates. Changes in estimates and judgments are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which changes are made and, if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the Standalone financial statements.

# 1.1 Company overview

The Company has its primary listings on the BSE Ltd. and National Stock Exchange of India Limited. The Company’s American Depositary Shares (ADS) representing equity shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

The Standalone financial statements are approved for issue by the Company's Board of Directors on April 18, 2024.

# 1.2 Basis of preparation of financial statements

These Standalone financial statements are prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) under the historical cost convention on accrual basis except for certain financial instruments, which are measured at fair values, the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (''the Act'') and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The Ind AS are prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and relevant amendment rules issued thereafter.

Accounting policies have been consistently applied except where a newly-issued accounting standard is initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in the accounting policy hitherto in use. The material accounting policy information used in preparation of the audited Standalone financial statements have been discussed in the respective notes. As the year to date figures are taken from the source and rounded to the nearest digits, the figures reported for the previous quarters might not always add up to the year to date figures reported in this statement.

# 1.3 Use of estimates and judgments

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the Management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and assumptions affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. The application of accounting policies that require critical accounting estimates involving complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions in these and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables, and allocation of transaction price to these distinct performance obligations involves significant judgment.

Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period. Revenue from fixed-price maintenance contract is recognized ratably using a percentage-of-completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and Company’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of the contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.

The Company uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for other fixed-price contracts. Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Company to determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgment and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information.

Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Company is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Company first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods.

or services before they are transferred to the customer. The Company considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or services, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the specified goods or services and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.

# b. Income taxes

The Company's two major tax jurisdictions are India and the United States, though the Company also files tax returns in other overseas jurisdictions. Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid / recovered for uncertain tax positions.

In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, Management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, management believes that the Company will realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced. Refer to Note 2.17.

# c. Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment represent a significant proportion of the asset base of the Company. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values of Company's assets are determined by the Management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology. Refer to Note 2.1.

# 2. Notes to the Standalone financial statements

# 2.1 Property, plant and equipment

# Accounting policy

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Costs directly attributable to acquisition are capitalized until the property, plant and equipment are ready for use, as intended by the Management. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected sale or retirement of the asset.

# Impairment

Property, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. An impairment loss is reversed in the Statement of Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of any accumulated depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.

# 2.2.2 Other intangible assets

Accounting policy

Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Intangible assets are amortized over their respective individual estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset is based on a number of factors, including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, and known technological advances), and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed periodically including at each financial year end.

Research costs are expensed as incurred. Software product development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and commercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future economic benefits are probable, the Company has an intention and ability to complete and use or sell the software and the costs can be measured reliably. The costs, which can be capitalized include the cost of material, direct labor, overhead costs that are directly attributable to prepare the asset for its intended use.

The changes in the carrying value of acquired intangible assets for the year ended March 31, 2024 are as follows:

| Particulars                                   | Customer-related (In ₹ crore) | Software-related (In ₹ crore) | Trade name-related (In ₹ crore) | Others (In ₹ crore) | Total (In ₹ crore) |

# 2.3 Leases

# Accounting Policy

# The Company as a Lessee

The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for land, buildings and computers. The Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (i) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.

At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

As a lessee, the Company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. The Company makes an assessment on the expected lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Company considers factors, such as any significant leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of the lease and the importance of the underlying asset to Infosys’s operations taking into account the location of the underlying asset and the availability of suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current economic circumstances.

Certain lease arrangements include the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.

The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. Right-of-use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

234 Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24

The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Company changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash flows.

# The Company as a lessor

Leases for which the Company is a lessor is classified as a finance or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

When the Company is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.

For operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

Immediately in the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognized in cash flow hedge reserve till the period the hedge was effective remains in cash flow hedge reserve until the forecasted transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve is transferred to the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss upon the occurrence of the related forecasted transaction. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in cash flow hedge reserve is reclassified to net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

# 2.11.3 Derecognition of financial instruments

The Company derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109. A financial liability (or a part of a financial liability) is derecognized from the Company's Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.

The Company holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for such contracts is generally a bank.

# 2.11.4 Fair value of financial instruments

In determining the fair value of its financial instruments, the Company uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each reporting date. The methods used to determine fair value include discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing model, market multiples, available quoted market prices and dealer quotes. All methods of assessing fair value result in general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized.

Refer to table 'Financial instruments by category' below for the disclosure on carrying value and fair value of financial assets and liabilities. For financial assets and liabilities maturing within one year from the Balance Sheet date and which are not carried at fair value, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

Derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized initially at fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognized in net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss when incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, these derivatives are measured at fair value through profit or loss and the resulting exchange gains or losses are included in other income. Assets / liabilities in this category are presented as current assets / current liabilities if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realized within 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.

# 2.11.5 Impairment

The Company recognizes loss allowances using the expected credit loss (ECL) model for the financial assets and unbilled revenues which are not fair valued through profit or loss. Loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues with no significant financing component is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition in which case those are measured at lifetime ECL.

The Company determines the allowance for credit losses based on historical loss experience adjusted to reflect current and estimated future economic conditions. The Company considers current and anticipated future economic conditions relating to industries the Company deals with and the countries where it operates.



Standalone Financial Statements

The amount of ECLs (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date to the amount that is required to be recorded is recognized as an impairment loss or gain in Statement of Profit and Loss.

(1) On account of fair value changes including interest accrued

(2) Excludes interest accrued on tax-free bonds and government bonds carried at amortized cost of ₹84 crore

(3) Excludes unbilled revenue on contracts where the right to consideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones

For trade receivables, trade payables, other assets and payables maturing within one year from the Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate the fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

# Fair value hierarchy

- Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3 – Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

During the year ended March 31, 2023, tax-free bonds and government securities of ₹383 crore were transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 of fair value hierarchy since these were valued based on quoted price. Further, non-convertible debentures of ₹1,611 crore were transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 of fair value hierarchy, since these were valued based on market observable inputs.

A one percentage point change in the unobservable inputs used in fair valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities does not have a significant impact in its value. The primary market risk to the Company is foreign exchange risk. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate foreign exchange related risk exposures.

Majority of investments of the Company are fair valued based on Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. These investments primarily include investment in liquid mutual fund units, target maturity fund units, tax-free bonds, certificates of deposit, commercial papers, treasury bills, government securities, non-convertible debentures, quoted bonds issued by government and quasi-government organizations. The Company invests after considering counterparty risks based on multiple criteria, including Tier I capital, Capital Adequacy Ratio, Credit Rating, Profitability, NPA levels and Deposit base of banks and financial institutions. These risks are monitored regularly as per Group's risk management program.

# Financial risk management

# Financial risk factors

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks – market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's primary focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the results of the Company’s operations are adversely affected as the rupee appreciates / depreciates against these currencies.

During the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the Company has designated certain foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecast cash transactions. The related hedge transactions for balance in cash flow hedge reserve as at March 31, 2024 are expected to occur and reclassified to Statement of Profit and Loss within three months.

The Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of its forecasted cash flows. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument, including whether the hedging instrument is expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items.

# Standalone Financial Statements

# Credit risk

Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by the counterparty resulting in a financial loss. The maximum exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily from trade receivables amounting to ₹25,152 crore and ₹20,773 crore as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively and unbilled revenue amounting to ₹10,814 crore and ₹12,384 crore as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively. Trade receivables and unbilled revenue are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue from customers majorly located in the United States of America and Europe.

Credit risk has always been managed by the Company through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of the customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company uses the expected credit loss model to assess any required allowances; and uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues. This matrix takes into account credit reports and other related credit information to the extent available.

The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristic of each customer and the concentration of risk from the top few customers. Exposure to customers is diversified and there is no single customer contributing more than 10% of outstanding trade receivables and unbilled revenues.

# The details in respect of percentage of revenues generated from top five customers and top ten customers are as follows:

| Particulars                     | Year ended March 31, | 2024 | 2023 |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---- | ---- |
| Revenue from top five customers |                      | 11.6 | 11.3 |
| Revenue from top ten customers  |                      | 18.9 | 19.6 |

# Credit risk exposure

The Company's credit period generally ranges from 30-75 days. The allowance for lifetime expected credit loss on customer balances recognized for the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is ₹108 crore and ₹139 crore, respectively. The movement in credit loss allowance on customer balance is as follows:

Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited as the Company generally invests in deposits with banks with high ratings assigned by international and domestic credit rating agencies. Ratings are monitored periodically and the Company has considered the latest available credit ratings as at the date of approval of these financial statements. The investments of the Company primarily include investment in liquid mutual fund units, target maturity fund units, tax-free bonds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, treasury bills, government securities, non-convertible debentures, quoted bonds issued by government and quasi government organizations. The Company invests after considering counterparty risks based on multiple criteria including Tier I Capital, Capital Adequacy Ratio, credit rating, profitability, NPA levels and deposit base of banks and financial institutions. These risks are monitored regularly as per Group’s risk management program.

As at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, 2,91,795 and 2,24,924 cash-settled options were outstanding, respectively. The carrying value of liability towards cash-settled, share-based payments was ₹13 crore and ₹4 crore as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively.

The fair value of the awards are estimated using the Black-Scholes Model for time and non-market performance-based options and Monte Carlo simulation model is used for TSR-based options. The inputs to the model include the share price at date of grant, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends, expected term and the risk free rate of interest. Expected volatility during the expected term of the options is based on historical volatility of the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the options. Expected volatility of the comparative Company have been modelled based on historical movements in the market prices of their publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the options. Correlation coefficient is calculated between each peer entity and the indices as a whole or between each entity in the peer group.

The fair value of each equity settled award is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:

# 2.16 Provisions

# Accounting policy

A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that is reasonably estimable, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.

# a. Post-sales client support

The Company provides its clients with a fixed-period post-sales support on its fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts. Costs associated with such support services are accrued at the time related revenues are recorded in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The Company estimates such costs based on historical experience and estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis for any material changes in assumptions and likelihood of occurrence.

# b. Onerous contracts

Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations under the contract. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognizes any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

Provision for post-sales client support and other provisions majorly represents costs associated with providing sales support services which are accrued at the time of recognition of revenues and are expected to be utilized over a period of one year.

# 2.17 Income taxes

# Accounting policy

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred income tax. Income tax expense is recognized in net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in equity or other comprehensive income. Current income tax for current and prior periods is recognized at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date and are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of changes in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment or the substantive enactment date. A deferred income tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilized. Deferred income taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and branches where it is expected that the earnings of the subsidiary or branch will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.

The Company offsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities; deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

The applicable Indian corporate statutory tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is 34.94%. Income tax expense for the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 includes reversal (net of provisions) of ₹913 crore and ₹116 crore, respectively. These reversals pertaining to prior periods is primarily on account of adjudication of certain disputed matters, upon filing of tax return and completion of assessments, across various jurisdictions.

During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company received orders under Sections 250 and 254 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, from the Income Tax Authorities in India for the assessment years, 2007-08 to 2015-16, 2017-18 and 2018-19. These orders confirmed the Company's position with respect to tax treatment of certain contentious matters. As a result interest income (pre-tax) of ₹1,933 crore was recognized and provision for income tax aggregating ₹525 crore was reversed with a corresponding credit to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Also, upon resolution of the disputes, an amount aggregating to ₹1,628 crore has been reduced from contingent liabilities.

The foreign tax expense is due to income taxes payable overseas, principally in the United States. In India, the Company has benefited from certain income tax incentives that the Government of India had provided for export of software and services from the units registered under the Special Economic Zones Act (SEZs), 2005. SEZ units, which began the provision of services on or after April 1, 2005 are eligible for a deduction of 100% of profits or gains derived from the export of services for the first five years from the financial year in which the unit commenced the provision of services and 50% of such profits or gains for further five years. Up to 50% of such profits or gains is also available for a further five years subject to creation of a Special Economic Zone re-investment Reserve out of the profit for the eligible SEZ units and utilization of such reserve by the Company for acquiring new plant and machinery for the purpose of its business as per the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961. (Refer to Special Economic Zone Re-investment reserve under Note 2.12 Equity).

Deferred income tax for the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 substantially relates to origination and reversal of temporary differences.

Infosys is subject to a 15% Branch Profit Tax (BPT) in the US to the extent its US branch's net profit during the year is greater than the increase in the net assets of the US branch during the year, computed in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code. As at March 31, 2024, Infosys' US branch net assets amounted to approximately ₹7,844 crore. As at March 31, 2024, the Company has a deferred tax liability for branch profit tax of ₹269 crore (net of credits), as the Company estimates that these branch profits are expected to be distributed in the foreseeable future.

Deferred income tax liabilities have not been recognized on temporary differences amounting to ₹10,776 crore and ₹10,948 crore as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively, associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches as the Company is able to control the timing of reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The Company majorly intends to repatriate earnings from subsidiaries and branches only to the extent these can be distributed in a tax-free manner.

Deferred income tax assets have not been recognized on accumulated losses of ₹1,358 crore each as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively as it is probable that future taxable profit will not be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilized in the foreseeable future. Majority of the accumulated losses as at March 31, 2023 will expire between financial years 2028 to 2030.

# The tax effects of significant temporary differences that resulted in deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

| Particulars                                   | As at March 31, 2024 |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Deferred income tax assets after set off      | –                    |
| Deferred income tax liabilities after set off | (1,509)              |

In assessing the reliability of deferred income tax assets, the Management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. The Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, management believes that the Company will realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced.

The Company’s Advanced Pricing Arrangement (APA) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for US branch income tax expired in March 2021. The Company has applied for renewal of APA and currently the US taxable income is based on the Company’s best estimate determined based on the expected value method.

The Company derives revenues primarily from IT services comprising software development and related services, cloud and infrastructure services, maintenance, consulting and package implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Company’s core and digital offerings (together called as “software-related services”). Contracts with customers are either on a time-and-material, unit of work, fixed-price or on a fixed-timeframe basis.

Revenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition and measurement when the contract has been approved in writing, by the parties, to the contract, the parties to contract are committed to perform their respective obligations under the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services (“performance obligations”) to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company has received or expects to receive in exchange for these products or services (“transaction price”). When there is uncertainty as to collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.

The Company assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In the absence of such evidence, the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin, under which the Company estimates the cost of satisfying the performance obligation and then adds an appropriate margin based on similar services.

# Revenue Recognition

The Company’s contracts may include variable consideration including rebates, volume discounts and penalties. The Company includes variable consideration as part of transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the variable consideration and when it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.

Revenue on time-and-material and unit of work-based contracts, are recognized as the related services are performed. Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or ratably using a percentage-of-completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and Company’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method. Efforts or costs expended are used to determine progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. Progress towards completion is measured as the ratio of costs or efforts incurred to date (representing work performed) to the estimated total costs or efforts. Estimates of transaction price and total costs or efforts are continuously monitored over the term of the contracts and are recognized in net profit in the period when these estimates change or when the estimates are revised. Revenues and the estimated total costs or efforts are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.

The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance-based billing and / or milestone-based progress billings. Revenues in excess of billing are classified as unbilled revenue while billing in excess of revenues are classified as contract liabilities (which we refer to as "unearned revenues").

In arrangements for software development and related services and maintenance services, by applying the revenue recognition criteria for each distinct performance obligation, the arrangements with customers generally meet the criteria for considering software development and related services as distinct performance obligations. For allocating the transaction price, the Company measures the revenue in respect of each performance obligation of a contract at its relative standalone selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In cases where the Company is unable to determine the standalone selling price, the Company uses the expected cost plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. For software development and related services, the performance obligations are satisfied as and when the services are rendered since the customer generally obtains control of the work as it progresses.

Certain cloud and infrastructure services contracts include multiple elements which may be subject to other specific accounting guidance, such as leasing guidance. These contracts are accounted in accordance with such specific accounting guidance. In such arrangements where the Company is able to determine that hardware and services are distinct performance obligations, it allocates the consideration to these performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. In the absence of standalone selling price, the Company uses the expected cost-plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. When such arrangements are considered as a single performance obligation, revenue is recognized over the period and measure of progress is determined based on promise in the contract.

Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a “right to use” the licenses is recognized at the time the license is made available to the customer. Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a “right to access” is recognized over the access period.

Arrangements to deliver software products generally have three elements: license, implementation and Annual Technical Services (ATS). When implementation services are provided in conjunction with the licensing arrangement and the license and implementation have been identified as two distinct separate performance obligations, the transaction price for such contracts are allocated to each performance obligation of the contract based on their relative standalone selling prices. In the absence of standalone selling price for implementation, the Company uses the expected cost plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. Where the license is required to be substantially customized as part of the implementation service the entire arrangement fee for license and implementation is considered to be a single performance obligation and the revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method as the implementation is performed. Revenue from client training, support and other services arising due to the sale of software products is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied. ATS revenue is recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the period in which the services are rendered.

Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Company is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Company first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer. The Company considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or services, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the specified goods or services and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.

A contract modification is a change in the scope or price or both of a contract that is approved by the parties to the contract. A contract modification that results in the addition of distinct performance obligations are accounted for either as a separate contract if the additional services are priced at the standalone selling price or as a termination of the existing contract and

creation of a new contract if they are not priced at the standalone selling price. If the modification does not result in a distinct performance obligation, it is accounted for as part of the existing contract on a cumulative catch-up basis.

The incremental costs of obtaining a contract (i.e., costs that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained) are recognized as an asset if the Company expects to recover them.

Certain eligible, nonrecurring costs (e.g. set-up or transition or transformation costs) that do not represent a separate performance obligation are recognized as an asset when such costs (a) relate directly to the contract; (b) generate or enhance resources of the Company that will be used in satisfying the performance obligation in the future; and (c) are expected to be recovered.

Capitalized contract costs relating to upfront payments to customers are amortized to revenue and other capitalized costs are amortized to expenses over the respective contract life on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods or services to customer to which the asset relates. Capitalized costs are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when present value of projected remaining operating cash flows is not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the capitalized costs.

The Company presents revenues net of indirect taxes in its Statement of Profit and Loss.

# Revenue from operations for the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is as follows:

| Particulars                         | Year ended March 31, 2024 | Year ended March 31, 2023 |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Revenue from software services      | 1,28,637                  | 1,23,755                  |
| Revenue from products and platforms | 296                       | 259                       |
| Total revenue from operations       | 1,28,933                  | 1,24,014                  |

# Products and platforms

The Company derives revenues from the sale of products and platforms, including Infosys Applied AI, which applies next-generation AI and machine learning.

The percentage of revenue from fixed-price contracts for the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is 56% and 55%, respectively.

# Trade receivables and contract balances

The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in receivables, unbilled revenue, and unearned revenue on the Company’s Balance Sheet. Amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) or upon achievement of contractual milestones.

The Company’s receivables are rights to consideration that are unconditional. Unbilled revenues comprising revenues in excess of billings from time and material contracts and fixed-price maintenance contracts are classified as financial asset when the right to consideration is unconditional and is due only after a passage of time.

Invoicing to the clients for other fixed-price contracts is based on milestones as defined in the contract and therefore the timing of revenue recognition is different from the timing of invoicing to the customers. Therefore unbilled revenues for other fixed-price contracts (contract asset) are classified as non-financial asset because the right to consideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones.

Invoicing in excess of earnings are classified as unearned revenue. Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of impairment in the Balance Sheet.

During the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the Company recognized revenue of ₹4,189 crore and ₹4,391 crore arising from opening unearned revenue as of April 1, 2023 and April 1, 2022, respectively.

During the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, ₹6,396 crore and ₹5,378 crore of unbilled revenue pertaining to other fixed-price and fixed-time frame contracts as of April 1, 2023 and April 1, 2022, respectively has been reclassified to trade receivables upon billing to customers on completion of milestones.

# Remaining performance obligation disclosure

The remaining performance obligation disclosure provides the aggregate amount of the transaction price yet to be recognized as at the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to when the Company expects to recognize these amounts in revenue. Applying the practical expedient as given in Ind AS 115, the Company has not disclosed the remaining performance obligation related disclosures for contracts where the revenue recognized corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity's performance completed to date, typically those contracts where invoicing is on time-and-material and unit of work-based contracts. Remaining performance obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustment for revenue that has not materialized and adjustments for currency fluctuations.

The aggregate value of performance obligations that are completely or partially unsatisfied as at March 31, 2024, other than those meeting the exclusion criteria mentioned above, is ₹80,334 crore. Out of this, the Company expects to recognize revenue of around 53.7% within the next one year and the remaining thereafter. The aggregate value of performance obligations that are completely or partially unsatisfied as at March 31, 2023 was ₹70,680 crore. The contracts can generally be terminated by the customers and typically includes an enforceable termination penalty payable by them. Generally, customers have not terminated contracts without cause.


# 2.19 Other income, net

# 2.19.1 Other income

Accounting policy

Other income is comprised primarily of interest income, dividend income, gain / loss on investments and exchange gain / loss on forward and options contracts and on translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive payment is established.

# 2.19.2 Foreign currency

Accounting policy

Functional currency

The functional currency of the Company is the Indian rupee. These financial statements are presented in Indian rupees (rounded off to crore; one crore equals ten million).

Transactions and translations

Foreign-currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated into the relevant functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the Balance Sheet date. The gains or losses resulting from such translations are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss and reported within exchange gains / (losses) on translation of assets and liabilities, net, except when deferred in Other Comprehensive Income as qualifying cash flow hedges. Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of the transaction. The related revenue and expense are recognized using the same exchange rate.

Transaction gains or losses realized upon settlement of foreign currency transactions are included in determining net profit for the period in which the transaction is settled. Revenue, expense and cash-flow items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currencies using the exchange rate in effect on the date of the transaction. Other Comprehensive Income, net of taxes includes translation differences on non-monetary financial assets measured at fair value at the reporting date, such as equities classified as financial instruments and measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).

Government grant

The Company recognizes government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them shall be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government grants related to assets are treated as deferred income and are recognized in the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a systematic and rational basis over the useful life of the asset. Government grants related to revenue are recognized on a systematic basis in the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs which they are intended to compensate.

# 2.21 Employee benefits

# Accounting policy

# 2.21.1 Gratuity and pensions

The Company provides for gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan ("the Gratuity Plan") covering eligible Indian employees. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee's salary and the tenure of employment with the Company. The Company contributes gratuity liabilities to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust ("the Trust"). Trustees administer contributions made to the Trusts and contributions are invested in a scheme with the Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law.

The Company operates defined benefit pension plan in certain overseas jurisdictions, in accordance with the local laws. These plans are managed by third-party fund managers. The plans provide for periodic payouts after retirement and / or a lumpsum payment as set out in rules of each fund and includes death and disability benefits. The defined benefit plans require contributions, which are based on a percentage of salary that varies depending on the age of the respective employees. Liabilities with regard to these defined benefit plans are determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an external actuary, at each Balance Sheet date using the projected unit credit method. These defined benefit plans expose the Company to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest rate risk and market risk.

The Company recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit plan in its Balance Sheet as an asset or liability. Gains and losses through re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability / (asset) are recognized in other comprehensive income and are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. The actual return of the portfolio of plan assets, in excess of the yields computed by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation is recognized in other comprehensive income. The effect of any plan amendments is recognized in net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

# 2.21.2 Provident fund

Eligible employees of Infosys receive benefits from a provident fund, which is a defined benefit plan. Both the eligible employee and the Company make monthly contributions to the provident fund plan equal to a specified percentage of the covered employee's salary. The Company contributes a portion to the Infosys Limited Employees' Provident Fund Trust. The Trust invests in specific designated instruments as permitted by Indian law. The remaining portion is contributed to the government administered pension fund. The rate at which the annual interest is payable to the beneficiaries by the trust is being administered by the Government. The Company has an obligation to make good the shortfall, if any, between the return from the investments of the Trust and the notified interest rate.

# 2.21.3 Superannuation

Certain employees of Infosys are participants in a defined contribution plan. The Company has no further obligations to the Plan beyond its monthly contributions, which are periodically contributed to a trust fund, the corpus of which is invested with the Life Insurance Corporation of India.

# 2.21.4 Compensated absences

The Company has a policy on compensated absences which are both accumulating and non-accumulating in nature. The expected cost of accumulating compensated absences is determined by actuarial valuation performed by an external actuary at each Balance Sheet date using projected unit credit method on the additional amount expected to be paid / availed as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the Balance Sheet date. Expense on non-accumulating compensated absences is recognized in the period in which the absences occur.

(1) For domestic defined benefit plan in India, the market for high quality corporate bonds being not developed, the yield of government bonds is considered as the discount rate. For most of our overseas defined benefit plan, given that the market for high quality corporate bonds is not developed, the Government bond rate adjusted for corporate spreads is used.

(2) The average rate of increase in compensation levels is determined by the Company, considering factors such as, the Company’s past compensation revision trends, inflation in respective markets and management’s estimate of future salary increases.

(3) Attrition rate considered is the Management’s estimate based on the past long-term trend of employee turnover in the Company. The tenure has been considered taking into account the past long-term trend of employees' average remaining service life which reflects the average estimated term of post-employment benefit obligation.

# For domestic defined benefit plan in India, assumptions

regarding future mortality experience are set in accordance with the published statistics by the Life Insurance Corporation of India. For overseas defined benefit plan, the assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set with regard to the latest statistics in life expectancy, plan experience and other relevant data.

The Company assesses all the above assumptions with its projected long-term plans of growth and prevalent industry standards.

The Company contributes all ascertained liabilities towards gratuity to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust. Trustees administer contributions made to the trust. The plan assets of the overseas defined benefit plan have been primarily invested in insurer managed funds and the asset allocation for plan assets is determined based on the investment criteria prescribed under the relevant regulations applicable to pension funds and the insurer managers. The insurers' investment are diversified and provide for guaranteed interest rates arrangements.

Actual return on assets (including remeasurement) of the gratuity plan for the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 were ₹125 crore and ₹111 crore, respectively and for the pension plan were ₹21 crore and (₹44) crore, respectively.

The contributions for gratuity are invested in a scheme with the Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law. The details of major plan assets into various categories as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 are as follows:

# Life expectancy and investment risk:

The pension fund offers the choice between a lifelong pension and a cash lump sum upon retirement. The pension fund has defined rates for converting the lump sum to a pension and there is the risk that the members live longer than implied by these conversion rates and that the pension assets don’t achieve the investment return implied by these conversion rates.

# Asset volatility:

A proportion of the pension fund is held in equities, which is expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term but give exposure to volatility and risk in the short term. The pension fund board of insurer is responsible for the investment strategy and equity allocation is justified given the long-term investment horizon of the pension fund and the objective to provide a reasonable long term return on members’ account balances.

# The sensitivity of significant assumptions used for valuation of defined benefit obligation is as follows :

| Impact from                                             | (In ₹ crore)  | As at March 31, 2024 | Gratuity | Pension |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| 1% point increase / decrease                            | Discount rate | 102                  | 28       |         |
| Weighted average rate of increase in compensation level | 93            | 4                    |          |         |

Sensitivity for significant actuarial assumptions is computed by varying one actuarial assumption used for the valuation, keeping all other actuarial assumptions constant. In practice, this is not probable, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.

These defined benefit plans expose the Company to actuarial risk which are set out below:

# Interest rate risk:

The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is generally calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to government bond yields and in certain overseas jurisdictions, it is calculated in reference to government bond yield adjusted for a corporate spread. If bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.

# The maturity profile of defined benefit obligation is as follows:

| Particulars | (In ₹ crore)  | Gratuity | Pension |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------- | ------- |
|             | Within 1 year | 244      | 43      |

The asset allocation for plan assets is determined based on the investment criteria prescribed under the relevant regulations. The actuarial valuation of PF liability exposes the Company to interest rate risk. The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a discount rate based on government bonds. If bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.

As at March 31, 2024, the defined benefit obligation would be affected by approximately ₹66 crore and ₹110 crore on account of 0.25% increase / decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets. The Company contributed ₹1,100 crore and ₹1,053 crore to the provident fund during the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively. The same has been recognized in the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss under the head employee benefit expense. The provident plans are applicable only to employees drawing a salary in Indian rupees.

# Accounting policy

Basic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per equity share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. The dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the equity shares been actually issued at fair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding equity shares). Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as at the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date. Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently for each period presented.

The number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any share splits and bonus shares issues including for changes effected prior to the approval of the financial statements by the Board of Directors.

# A reconciliation of the equity shares used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per equity share is as follows:

# 2.23 Contingent liabilities and commitments

Accounting policy

Contingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity or a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

# Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

# Opinion

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of INFOSYS LIMITED (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the “Group”) which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2024, and the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended on that date, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as the “Consolidated Financial Statements”).

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Consolidated Financial Statements, give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2024 and their consolidated profit, their consolidated total comprehensive income, their consolidated changes in equity and their consolidated cash flows for the year ended on that date.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“SAs”) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

# Emphasis of Matter

As described in note 2.24.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain costs relating to possible damages or claims relating to a cybersecurity incident in a subsidiary are indeterminable as at the date of this report because of reasons stated in the note. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

# Key Audit Matters

| Sr. No. | Key Audit Matter    |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| 1       | Revenue recognition |

The Group’s contracts with customers include contracts with multiple products and services. The group derives revenues from IT services comprising software development and related services, maintenance, consulting and package implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Group’s core and digital offerings and business process management services. The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables involves significant judgement.

In certain integrated services arrangements, contracts with customers include subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods or services before it is transferred to the customer. The Group considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or services, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the products or service and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.

Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on (1) a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.

As certain contracts with customers involve management’s judgment in (1) identifying distinct performance obligations, (2) determining whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition from these judgments were identified as a key audit matter and required a higher extent of audit effort. Refer Notes 1.5 and 2.18 to the consolidated financial statements.

# Auditor’s Response

Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following:

Our audit procedures related to the (1) identification of distinct performance obligations, (2) determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method included the following, among others:

- We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the (a) identification of distinct performance obligations, (b) determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (c) determination of whether fixed price maintenance revenue for certain contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method.
- We selected a sample of contracts with customers and performed the following procedures:
- Obtained and read contract documents for each selection, including master service agreements, and other documents that were part of the agreement.
- Identified significant terms and deliverables in the contract to assess management’s conclusions regarding the (i) identification of distinct performance obligations (ii) whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (iii) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method.

# Key Audit Matter

# 2. Revenue recognition - Fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method

Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either (1) on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.

Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Group to determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.

We identified the estimate of total efforts or costs to complete fixed price contracts measured using the percentage of completion method as a key audit matter as the estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. This estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts or costs incurred to-date and estimates of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations over the term of the contracts.

This required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence and a higher extent of audit effort to evaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts.

Refer Notes 1.5 and 2.18 to the consolidated financial statements.

# Auditor’s Response

# Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following:

Our audit procedures related to estimates of total expected costs or efforts to complete for fixed-price contracts included the following, among others:

- We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to (1) recording of efforts or costs incurred and estimation of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations and (2) access and application controls pertaining to time recording, allocation and budgeting systems which prevents unauthorised changes to recording of efforts incurred.
- We selected a sample of fixed price contracts with customers measured using the percentage-of-completion method and performed the following:

Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board’s Report including Annexures to Board’s Report, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, Corporate Governance and Shareholder’s Information, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, standalone financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including Ind AS specified under section 133 of the Act. The respective Boards of Directors/Trustees of the entities included in the Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Company, as aforesaid.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Boards of Directors/Trustees of the entities included in the Group are responsible for assessing the ability of the respective entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Boards of Directors either intends to liquidate their respective entities or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The respective Boards of Directors/Trustees of the entities included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company and its subsidiary companies which are companies incorporated in India, has adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify.

# Consolidated Financial Statements

our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the consolidated financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the consolidated financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the consolidated financial statements.

We communicate with those charged with governance of the Company and such other entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal financial controls that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Annexure “A” To The Independent Auditor’s Report

# Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements under Clause (i) of sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”)

In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024, we have audited the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of INFOSYS LIMITED (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”) and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, as of that date.

# Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The respective Boards of Directors of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the respective Companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.

# Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India.

# Consolidated Financial Statements

# Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements

A company's internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

# Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

# Opinion

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system with reference to consolidated financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024, based on the criteria for internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements established by the respective companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI.

Consolidated Financial Statements
# Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

# Accounting policy

Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit for the year is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and items of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated. The Group considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash to be cash equivalents.

As the year-end figures are taken from the source and rounded to the nearest digits, the figures reported for the previous quarters might not always add up to the year-end figures reported in this statement.

# 1.3 Basis of consolidation

Infosys consolidates entities which it owns or controls. The Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company, its controlled trusts and its subsidiaries. Control exists when the parent has power over the entity, is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns by using its power over the entity. Power is demonstrated through existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant activities, those which significantly affect the entity's returns. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control commences until the date control ceases.

The financial statements of the Group companies are consolidated on a line-by-line basis and intra-group balances and transactions including unrealized gain / loss from such transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. These financial statements are prepared by applying uniform accounting policies in use at the Group. Non-controlling interests which represent part of the net profit or loss and net assets of subsidiaries that are not, directly or indirectly, owned or controlled by the Company, are excluded.

Refer to Note 2.25 for the list of subsidiaries and controlled trusts of the Company.

# 1.4 Use of estimates and judgments

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the Management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and assumptions affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. The application of accounting policies that require critical accounting estimates involving complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions in these financial statements have been disclosed in Note 1.5. Accounting estimates could change from period to period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Appropriate changes in estimates are made as the Management becomes aware of changes in circumstances surrounding the estimates. Changes in estimates and judgments are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which changes are made and, if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the Consolidated financial statements.

# 1.5 Critical accounting estimates and judgments

a. Revenue recognition

The Group’s contracts with customers include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Revenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition and measurement when the contract has been approved, in writing, by the parties to the contract, the parties to contract are committed to perform their respective obligations under the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables, and allocation of transaction price to these distinct performance obligations involves significant judgment.

Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period. Revenue from fixed-price maintenance contract is recognized ratably using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of the contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.

The Group uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for other fixed-price contracts. Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Group to determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgment and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information.

Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer. The Group considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or services, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the specified goods or services and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.

Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract. Income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, the Management believes that the Group will realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced. Also, refer to Note 2.17.

# c. Business combinations and intangible assets

Business combinations are accounted for using Ind AS 103, Business Combinations. Ind AS 103 requires us to fair value identifiable intangible assets and contingent consideration to ascertain the net fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. These valuations are conducted by external valuation experts. Estimates are required to be made in determining the value of contingent consideration, value of option arrangements and intangible assets. These measurements are based on information available at the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management (Refer to Note 2.1 and 2.4.2).

# d. Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment represent a significant proportion of the asset base of the Group. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values of Group's assets are determined by the Management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology. Also, refer to Note 2.2.

# e. Impairment of goodwill

Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of a Cash Generating Unit (CGU) is less than its carrying amount. For the impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or groups of CGUs which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and which represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.

# b. Income taxes

The Group's two major tax jurisdictions are India and the United States, though the Company also files tax returns in other overseas jurisdictions. Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid / recovered for uncertain tax positions.

In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, the Management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. The Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income.

# 2. Notes to the Consolidated financial statements

# 2.1 Business combinations

Accounting policy

Business combinations have been accounted for using the acquisition method under the provisions of Ind AS 103, Business Combinations.

309

Consolidated Financial Statements

The purchase price in an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of acquisition, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. The purchase price also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value on the date of acquisition. Contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

The interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity of subsidiaries.

Business combinations between entities under common control is accounted for at carrying value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Group's consolidated financial statements. The payments related to options issued by the Group over the non-controlling interests in its subsidiaries are accounted as financial liabilities and initially recognized at the estimated present value of gross obligations. Such options are subsequently measured at fair value in order to reflect the amount payable under the option at the date at which it becomes exercisable. In the event that the option expires unexercised, the liability is derecognized.

The purchase price is allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon determination of fair values at the dates of acquisition is as follows :

| Component                                                | Acquiree's carrying amount | Fair value adjustments | Purchase price allocated |

(1) Includes cash and cash equivalents acquired of ₹26 crore. The excess of the purchase consideration paid over the fair value of assets acquired has been attributed to goodwill. The primary items that generated this goodwill are the value of the acquired assembled workforce and estimated synergies, neither of which qualify as an intangible asset. Goodwill is not tax-deductible. Goodwill pertaining to these business combinations is allocated to operating segments as more fully described in Note 2.4.1.

During the year ended March 31, 2023, the Group completed two business combinations to complement its digital offerings by acquiring 100% voting interests in:

1. oddity GmbH, oddity group services GmbH, oddity space GmbH, oddity jungle GmbH, oddity code GmbH and oddity waves GmbH (collectively known as oddity), a Germany-based digital marketing, experience, and commerce agencies on April 20, 2022.
2. BASE life science A/S, a consulting and technology firm in the life Science industry in Europe on September 1, 2022.

These acquisitions are expected to strengthen the Group’s creative, branding and experience design capabilities and augment the Group’s life sciences expertise, scales its digital transformation capabilities with cloud-based industry solutions and expand its presence across Europe.

Additionally, these acquisitions have shareholder and employee retention bonus payable to the employees of the acquiree over three years, subject to their continuous employment with the Group along with achievement of financial targets for the respective years. Performance and retention bonus is recognized in employee benefit expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss over the period of service.

Fair value of trade receivables acquired, is ₹111 crore as of acquisition date and as of March 31, 2024, the amounts are fully collected. Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination such as finder’s fees, legal fees, due diligence fees, and other professional and consulting fees are expensed as incurred.

Proposed acquisitions

On January 11, 2024, Infosys Limited entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the equity share capital in InSemi Technology Services Private Limited, a semiconductor design services company headquartered in India, for a consideration including earn-outs, and management incentives and retention bonuses totaling up to ₹280 crore (approximately $34 million), subject to customary closing adjustments.

On April 18, 2024, Infosys Germany GmBH, a wholly-owned step down subsidiary of Infosys Limited, entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the equity share capital in in-tech Holding GmbH, leading provider of Engineering R&#x26;D services headquartered in Germany, for a consideration including earn-outs amounting up to EUR 450 million (approximately ₹4,045 crore), subject to customary closing adjustments.

Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet date is classified as capital advances under other non-current assets and the cost of assets not ready to use before such date are disclosed under ‘Capital work-in-progress’. Subsequent expenditures relating to property, plant and equipment is capitalized only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with these will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the financial statements upon sale or retirement of the asset.

# 2.2 Property, plant and equipment

# Accounting policy

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Costs directly attributable to acquisition are capitalized until the property, plant and equipment are ready for use, as intended by the Management. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived at after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The Group depreciates property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:

| Buildings (1)              | 22-25 years                                     |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Plant and machinery (1)(2) | 5 years                                         |
| Office equipment           | 5 years                                         |
| Computer equipment (1)     | 3-5 years                                       |
| Furniture and fixtures (1) | 5 years                                         |
| Vehicles(1)                | 5 years                                         |
| Leasehold improvements     | Lower of useful life of the asset or lease term |

(1) Based on technical evaluation, the Management believes that the useful lives as given above best represent the period over which the Management expects to use these assets. Hence, the useful lives for these assets is different from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013.

(2) Includes solar plant with a useful life of 25 years.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The useful lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology.

# 2.4 Goodwill and other intangible assets

# 2.4.1 Goodwill

# Accounting policy

Goodwill represents the purchase consideration in excess of the Group's interest in the net fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity. When the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired exceeds purchase consideration, the fair value of net assets acquired is reassessed and the bargain purchase gain is recognized in capital reserve. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

# Impairment

Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of a Cash Generating Unit (CGU) is less than its carrying amount. For the impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or groups of CGUs which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and which represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets. Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of a CGU including the goodwill, exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. Value-in-use is the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from the CGU. Key assumptions in the cash flow projections are prepared based on current economic conditions and includes estimated long term growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and estimated operating margins.

A summary of changes in the carrying amount of goodwill is as follows :

| Particulars                                  | As at March 31, | 2024  | 2023  |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ----- | ----- |
| Carrying value at the beginning              |                 | 7,248 | 6,195 |
| Goodwill on acquisitions (Refer to Note 2.1) |                 | –     | 630   |
| Translation differences                      |                 | 55    | 423   |
| Carrying value at the end                    |                 | 7,303 | 7,248 |

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the CGU or groups of CGUs, which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. The Group internally reviews the goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level, after allocation of the goodwill to CGUs or groups of CGUs.

The allocation of goodwill to operating segments as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is as follows :

| Segment                                   | As at March 31,                                 | 2024  | 2023  |

314    Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24


The goodwill pertaining to Panaya amounting to ₹972 crore and ₹959 crore as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively is tested for impairment at the entity level. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. The fair value of a CGU is determined based on the market capitalization. Value-in-use is determined based on discounted future cash flows. The key assumptions used for the calculations are as follows :

| Particulars           | As at March 31, 2024 | As at March 31, 2023 |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Long-term growth rate | 7-10                 | 8-10                 |
| Operating margins     | 19-21                | 19-21                |
| Discount rate         | 13                   | 13                   |

The above discount rate is based on the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of the Company. As at March 31, 2024, the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU exceeded its carrying amount. Reasonable sensitivities in key assumptions is unlikely to cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount of the cash generating units.

# 2.4.2 Intangible assets

# Accounting policy

Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Intangible assets are amortized over their respective individual estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset is based on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, and known technological advances) and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed periodically including at each financial year end.

Research costs are expensed as incurred. Software product development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and commercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future economic benefits are probable, the Group has an intention and ability to complete and use or sell the software and the costs can be measured reliably. The costs which can be capitalized include the cost of material, direct labor, overhead costs that are directly attributable to prepare the asset for its intended use.

# Impairment

Intangible assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs.

If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. An impairment loss is reversed in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of any accumulated amortization) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.

The changes in the carrying value of acquired intangible assets for the year ended March 31, 2024 are as follows :

# 2.11 Financial instruments

# Accounting policy

The Group recognizes financial assets and financial liabilities when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities, which are not at fair value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial recognition. Regular way purchase and sale of financial assets are accounted for at trade date.

# 2.11.2 Subsequent measurement

# a. Non-derivative financial instruments

# (i) Financial assets carried at amortized cost

A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortized cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

# (ii) Financial assets carried at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

A financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The Group has made an irrevocable election for its

# Consolidated Financial Statements

Investments which are classified as equity instruments to present the subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income based on its business model.

# (iii) Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above categories are subsequently fair valued through profit or loss.

# (iv) Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method, except for contingent consideration and financial liability under option arrangements recognized in a business combination which is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.

The reserve till the period the hedge was effective remains in cash flow hedging reserve until the forecasted transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in the cash flow hedging reserve is transferred to the net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss upon the occurrence of the related forecasted transaction. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified to net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

# 2.11.3 Derecognition of financial instruments

The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109. A financial liability (or a part of a financial liability) is derecognized from the Group's Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.

# b. Derivative financial instruments

The Group holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for such contracts is generally a bank.

# (i) Financial assets or financial liabilities, carried at fair value through profit or loss.

This category includes derivative financial assets or liabilities which are not designated as hedges. Although the Group believes that these derivatives constitute hedges from an economic perspective, they may not qualify for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments. Any derivative that is either not designated as hedge, or is so designated but is ineffective as per Ind AS 109, is categorized as a financial asset or financial liability, at fair value through profit or loss.

Derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized initially at fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognized in net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, these derivatives are measured at fair value through profit or loss and the resulting exchange gains or losses are included in other income. Assets / liabilities in this category are presented as current assets / current liabilities if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realized within 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.

# (ii) Cash flow hedge

The Group designates certain foreign exchange forward and options contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecast cash transactions. When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized immediately in the net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognized in cash flow hedging.

# 2.11.4 Fair value of financial instruments

In determining the fair value of its financial instruments, the Group uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each reporting date. The methods used to determine fair value include discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing model, market multiples, available quoted market prices and dealer quotes. All methods of assessing fair value result in general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized. Refer to table 'Financial instruments by category' below for the disclosure on carrying value and fair value of financial assets and liabilities. For financial assets and liabilities maturing within one year from the Balance Sheet date and which are not carried at fair value, the carrying amounts approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

# 2.11.5 Impairment

The Group recognizes loss allowances using the expected credit loss (ECL) model for the financial assets and unbilled revenue which are not fair valued through profit or loss. Loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues with no significant financing component is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, ECLs are measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition in which case those are measured at lifetime ECL.

The Group determines the allowance for credit losses based on historical loss experience adjusted to reflect current and estimated future economic conditions. The Group considers current and anticipated future economic conditions relating to industries the Group deals with and the countries where it operates. The amount of ECL (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date to the amount that is required to be recorded is recognized as an impairment loss or gain in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

(1) On account of fair value changes including interest accrued

(2) Excludes interest accrued on tax-free bonds and government bonds carried at amortized cost of ₹84 crore

(3) Excludes unbilled revenue on contracts where the right to consideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones

For trade receivables and trade payables and other assets and payables maturing within one year from the Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate the fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

# Fair value hierarchy

Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

Level 3 – Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

During the year ended March 31, 2023, government securities and tax-free bonds of ₹383 crore were transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 of fair value hierarchy, since these were valued based on quoted price. Further, non-convertible debentures of ₹1,611 crore were transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 of fair value hierarchy, since these were valued based on market observable inputs. A one percentage point change in the unobservable inputs used in fair valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities does not have a significant impact in its value.

Majority of investments of the Group are fair valued based on Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. These investments primarily include investment in liquid mutual fund units, target maturity fund units, tax-free bonds, certificates of deposit, commercial papers, treasury bills, government securities, non-convertible debentures, quoted bonds issued by government and quasi-government organizations. The Group invests after considering counterparty risks based on multiple criteria including Tier I capital, Capital Adequacy Ratio, Credit Rating, Profitability, NPA levels and Deposit base of banks and financial institutions. These risks are monitored regularly as per Group's risk management program.

The focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimize potential adverse effects on its financial performance. The primary market risk to the Group is foreign exchange risk. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate foreign exchange related risk exposures. The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristic of each customer and the concentration of risk from the top few customers.

# Market risk

The Group operates internationally and a major portion of the business is transacted in several currencies and consequently the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its sales and services in the United States and elsewhere, and purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. The Group holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The Group is also exposed to foreign exchange risk arising on intercompany transaction in foreign currencies. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the results of the Group’s operations are adversely affected as the rupee appreciates / depreciates against these currencies.

During the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the Group has designated certain foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecast cash transactions. The related hedge transactions for balance in cash flow hedges as of March 31, 2024 are expected to occur and will be reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss within three months.

The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of its forecasted cash flows. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument, including whether the hedging instrument is expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items.

If the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal but the risk management objective remains unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced by adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for risk management purposes. Any hedge ineffectiveness is calculated and accounted for in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss at the time of the hedge relationship rebalancing.

The reconciliation of cash flow hedge reserve for the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is as follows:

# Credit risk

Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by the counterparty resulting in a financial loss. The maximum exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily from trade receivables amounting to ₹30,193 crore and ₹25,424 crore as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively and unbilled revenues amounting to ₹14,548 crore and ₹16,738 crore as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively. Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues from customers primarily located in the United States of America. Credit risk has always been managed by the Group through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Group grants credit terms in the normal course of business.

The Group uses the expected credit loss model to assess any required allowances; and uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues. This matrix takes into account credit reports and other related credit information to the extent available.

The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristic of each customer and the concentration of risk from the top few customers. Exposure to customers is diversified and there is no single customer contributing more than 10% of outstanding trade receivables and unbilled revenues.

As at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, 2,91,795 and 2,24,924 cash-settled options were outstanding, respectively. The carrying value of liability towards cash-settled, share-based payments was ₹13 crore and ₹4 crore as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively.

The fair value of the awards are estimated using the Black-Scholes Model for time and non-market performance-based options and Monte Carlo simulation model is used for TSR-based options. The inputs to the model include the share price at date of grant, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends, expected term and the risk free rate of interest. Expected volatility during the expected term of the options is based on historical volatility of the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the options. Expected volatility of the comparative company have been modelled based on historical movements in the market prices of their publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the options. Correlation coefficient is calculated between each peer entity and the indices as a whole or between each entity in the peer group.

The fair value of each equity-settled award is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:

For the year ended March 31, 2023, ₹118 crore was settled directly by the third party to the customer on behalf of the Group and accordingly considered as non-cash transaction. |                      |        |    |   |

# 2.16 Provisions

# Accounting policy

A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that is reasonably estimable, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.

# a. Post-sales client support

The Group provides its clients with a fixed-period post-sales support on its fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts. Costs associated with such support services are accrued at the time related revenues are recorded and included in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. The Group estimates such costs based on historical experience and estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis for any material changes in assumptions and likelihood of occurrence.

# b. Onerous contracts

Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations under the contract. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Group recognizes any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

# 2.17 Income taxes

# Accounting policy

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred income tax. Income tax expense is recognized in net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in equity or other comprehensive income. Current income tax for current and prior periods is recognized at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date and are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of changes

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24

In tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment or the substantive enactment date. A deferred income tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilized. Deferred income taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and branches where it is expected that the earnings of the subsidiary or branch will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.

The Group offsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities; deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Tax benefits of deductions earned on exercise of employee share options in excess of compensation charged to income are credited to equity.

# Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss comprises:

The applicable Indian corporate statutory tax rate for the years ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is 34.94% each. Income tax expense for the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 includes reversal (net of provisions) of ₹937 crore and ₹106 crore, respectively. These reversals pertaining to prior periods are primarily on account of adjudication of certain disputed matters, upon filing of tax return and completion of assessments, across various jurisdictions.

During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company received orders under Sections 250 and 254 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, from the Income Tax Authorities in India for the assessment years, 2007-08 to 2015-16, 2017-18 and 2018-19. These orders confirmed the Company's position with respect to tax treatment of certain contentious matters. As a result, interest income (pre-tax) of ₹1,933 crore was recognized and provision for income tax aggregating ₹525 crore was reversed with a corresponding credit to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Also, upon resolution of the disputes, an amount aggregating to ₹1,628 crore has been reduced from contingent liabilities.

The foreign tax expense is due to income taxes payable overseas principally in the United States. In India, the Group has benefited from certain tax incentives that the Government of India had provided for export of software and services from the units registered under the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) Act, 2005.

Consolidated Financial Statements

# The deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows :

| Particulars                                   | Year ended March 31, | 2024    | 2023    |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| Deferred income tax assets after set off      |                      | 454     | 1,245   |
| Deferred income tax liabilities after set off |                      | (1,794) | (1,220) |

In assessing the reliability of deferred income tax assets, the management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. The management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, the Management believes that the Group will realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced.

The Company’s Advanced Pricing Arrangement (APA) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for US branch income tax expired in March 2021. The Company has applied for renewal of APA and currently the US taxable income is based on the Company’s best estimate determined based on the expected value method.

# 2.18 Revenue from operations

# Accounting policy

The Group derives revenues primarily from IT services comprising software development and related services, cloud and infrastructure services, maintenance, consulting and package implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Group’s core and digital offerings (together called as “software-related services”) and business process management services. Contracts with customers are either on a time-and-material, unit of work, fixed-price or on a fixed-timeframe basis. Revenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition and measurement when the contract has been approved in writing by the parties, to the contract, the parties to contract are committed to perform their respective obligations under the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable.

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services (“performance obligations”) to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Group has received or expects to receive in exchange for these products or services (“transaction price”). When there is uncertainty as to collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.

The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. The Group allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In the absence of such evidence, the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin, under which the Group estimates the cost of satisfying the performance obligation and then adds an appropriate margin based on similar services.

The Group’s contracts may include variable consideration including rebates, volume discounts and penalties. The Group includes variable consideration as part of transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the variable consideration and when it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.

Revenue on time-and-material and unit of work based contracts, are recognized as the related services are performed. Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or ratably using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method. Efforts or costs expended are used to determine progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. Progress towards completion is measured as the ratio of costs or efforts incurred to date (representing work performed) to the estimated total costs or efforts. Estimates of transaction price and total costs or efforts are continuously monitored over the term of the contracts and are recognized in net profit in the period when these estimates change or when the estimates are revised. Revenues and the estimated total costs or efforts are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.

The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance-based billing and / or milestone-based progress billings. Revenues in excess of billing are classified as unbilled revenue while billing in excess of revenues are classified as contract liabilities (which we refer to as unearned revenues).

In arrangements for software development and related services and maintenance services, by applying the revenue recognition criteria for each distinct performance obligation, the arrangements with customers generally meet the criteria for considering software development and related services as distinct performance obligations. For allocating the transaction price, the Group measures the revenue in respect of each performance obligation of a contract at its relative standalone selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In cases where the Group is unable to determine the standalone selling price, the Group uses the expected cost.

# Revenue Recognition

plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. For software development and related services, the performance obligations are satisfied as and when the services are rendered since the customer generally obtains control of the work as it progresses.

Certain cloud and infrastructure services contracts include multiple elements which may be subject to other specific accounting guidance, such as leasing guidance. These contracts are accounted in accordance with such specific accounting guidance. In such arrangements where the Group is able to determine that hardware and services are distinct performance obligations, it allocates the consideration to these performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. In the absence of standalone selling price, the Group uses the expected cost-plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. When such arrangements are considered as a single performance obligation, revenue is recognized over the period and measure of progress is determined based on promise in the contract.

Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a “right to use” the licenses is recognized at the time the license are made available to the customer. Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a “right to access” is recognized over the access period.

Arrangements to deliver software products generally have three elements: license, implementation and Annual Technical Services (ATS). When implementation services are provided in conjunction with the licensing arrangement and the license and implementation have been identified as two distinct separate performance obligations, the transaction price for such contracts are allocated to each performance obligation of the contract based on their relative standalone selling prices. In the absence of standalone selling price for implementation, the Group uses the expected cost plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. Where the license is required to be substantially customized as part of the implementation service the entire arrangement fee for license and implementation is considered to be a single performance obligation and the revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method as the implementation is performed.

Revenue from client training, support and other services arising due to the sale of software products is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied. ATS revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the period in which the services are rendered.

Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer. The Group considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or services, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the specified goods or services and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.

A contract modification is a change in the scope or price or both of a contract that is approved by the parties to the contract. A contract modification that results in the addition of distinct performance obligations are accounted for either as a separate contract if the additional services are priced at the standalone selling price or as a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract if they are not priced at the standalone selling price. If the modification does not result in a distinct performance obligation, it is accounted for as part of the existing contract on a cumulative catch-up basis.

The incremental costs of obtaining a contract (i.e., costs that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained) are recognized as an asset if the Group expects to recover them.

Certain eligible, non-recurring costs (e.g. set-up or transition or transformation costs) that do not represent a separate performance obligation are recognized as an asset when such costs (a) relate directly to the contract; (b) generate or enhance resources of the Group that will be used in satisfying the performance obligation in the future; and (c) are expected to be recovered.

Capitalized contract costs relating to upfront payments to customers are amortized to revenue and other capitalized costs are amortized to expenses over the respective contract life on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods or services to customer to which the asset relates. Capitalized costs are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when present value of projected remaining operating cash flows is not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the capitalized costs.

The Group presents revenues net of indirect taxes in its Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

* Geographical revenue is based on the domicile of customer

The percentage of revenue from fixed-price contracts for each of the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is approximately 53% and 52%, respectively.

# Trade receivables and contract balances

The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in receivables, unbilled revenue, and unearned revenue on the Group’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) or upon achievement of contractual milestones.

The Group’s receivables are rights to consideration that are unconditional. Unbilled revenues comprising revenues in excess of billings from time and material contracts and fixed-price maintenance contracts are classified as financial asset when the right to consideration is unconditional and is due only after a passage of time.

Invoicing to the clients for other fixed-price contracts is based on milestones as defined in the contract and therefore the timing of revenue recognition is different from the timing of invoicing to the customers. Therefore, unbilled revenues for other fixed-price contracts (contract asset) are classified as non-financial asset because the right to consideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones.

Invoicing in excess of earnings are classified as unearned revenue.

Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of impairment in the consolidated Balance Sheet.

During the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the Company recognized revenue of ₹5,432 crore and ₹5,387 crore arising from opening unearned revenue as of April 1, 2023 and April 1, 2022, respectively.

During the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, ₹7,023 crore and ₹5,950 crore of unbilled revenue pertaining to other fixed-price and fixed-time frame contracts as of April 1, 2023 and April 1, 2022, respectively has been reclassified to trade receivables upon billing to customers on completion of milestones.

# Remaining performance obligation disclosure

The remaining performance obligation disclosure provides the aggregate amount of the transaction price yet to be recognized as at the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to when the Group expects to recognize these amounts in revenue. Applying the practical expedient as given in Ind AS 115, the Group has not disclosed the remaining performance obligation related disclosures for contracts where the revenue recognized corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity's performance completed to date, typically those contracts where invoicing is on time and material and unit of work-based contracts.

Remaining performance obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustment for revenue that has not materialized and adjustments for currency fluctuations.

The aggregate value of performance obligations that are completely or partially unsatisfied as at March 31, 2024, other than those meeting the exclusion criteria mentioned above, is ₹90,658 crore. Out of this, the Group expects to recognize revenue of around 53.0% within the next one year and the remaining thereafter. The aggregate value of performance obligations that are completely or partially unsatisfied as at March 31, 2023 was ₹80,867 crore. The contracts can generally be terminated by the customers and typically includes an enforceable termination penalty payable by them. Generally, customers have not terminated contracts without cause.

# Other income, net

# Accounting policy

Other income is comprised primarily of interest income, dividend income, gain / loss on investment and exchange gain / loss on forward and options contracts and on translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive payment is established.

# Foreign currency – Accounting policy

# Functional currency

The functional currency of Infosys, Infosys BPM, EdgeVerve, Skava, Infosys Green Forum, Danske IT and controlled trusts is the Indian rupee. The functional currencies for foreign subsidiaries are their respective local currencies. These financial statements are presented in Indian rupees (rounded off to crore; one crore equals ten million).

# Transactions and translations

Foreign-currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated into the relevant functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the Balance Sheet date. The gains or losses resulting from such translations are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss and reported within exchange gains / (losses) on translation of assets and liabilities, net, except when deferred in Other Comprehensive Income as qualifying cash flow hedges. Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of transaction. The related revenue and expense are recognized using the same exchange rate.

344 Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24



Transaction gains or losses realized upon settlement of foreign currency transactions are included in determining net profit for the period in which the transaction is settled. Revenue, expense and cash-flow items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currencies using the exchange rate in effect on the date of the transaction. The translation of financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries to the presentation currency is performed for assets and liabilities using the exchange rate in effect at the Balance Sheet date and for revenue, expense and cash-flow items using the average exchange rate for the respective periods. The gains or losses resulting from such translation are included in currency translation reserves under other components of equity. When a subsidiary is disposed off, in full, the relevant amount is transferred to net profit in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. However when a change in the parent's ownership does not result in loss of control of a subsidiary, such changes are recorded through equity.

Other Comprehensive Income, net of taxes includes translation differences on non-monetary financial assets measured at fair value at the reporting date, such as equities classified as financial instruments and measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the exchange rate in effect at the Balance Sheet date.

# Government grant

The Group recognizes government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government grants related to assets are treated as deferred income and are recognized in net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss on a systematic and rational basis over the useful life of the asset. Government grants related to revenue are recognized on a systematic basis in net profit in the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs which they are intended to compensate.

# Other income for the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is as follows :

Consolidated Financial Statements

# 2.21 Leases

# Accounting policy

# The Group as a lessee

The Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for land, buildings and computers. The Group assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether:

1. the contract involves the use of an identified asset
2. the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease
3. the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.

At the date of commencement of the lease, the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

As a lessee, the Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. The Group makes an assessment on the expected lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Company considers factors such as any significant leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of the lease and the importance of the underlying asset to Group’s operations taking into account the location of the underlying asset and the availability of suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current economic circumstances.

Certain lease arrangements include the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.

The ROU assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

The ROU assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.

The ROU assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Group changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option.

Lease liability and ROU assets have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash flows.

# The Group as a lessor

Leases for which the Group is a lessor is classified as a finance or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.

For operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

Consolidated Financial Statements

# 2.22 Employee benefits

# Accounting policy

# Gratuity and pensions

The Group provides for gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan ("the Gratuity Plan") covering eligible employees majorly of Infosys and its Indian subsidiaries. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee's salary and the tenure of employment with the Group. The Company contributes Gratuity liabilities to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust ("the Trust"). In case of Infosys BPM and EdgeVerve, contributions are made to the Infosys BPM Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust and EdgeVerve Systems Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust, respectively. Trustees administer contributions made to the Trusts and contributions are invested in a scheme with the Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law.

# Superannuation

Certain employees of Infosys, Infosys BPM and EdgeVerve are participants in a defined contribution plan. The Group has no further obligations to the plan beyond its monthly contributions which are periodically contributed to a trust fund, the corpus of which is invested with the Life Insurance Corporation of India.

# Compensated absences

The Group has a policy on compensated absences which are both accumulating and non-accumulating in nature. The expected cost of accumulating compensated absences is determined by actuarial valuation performed by an external actuary at each Balance Sheet date using projected unit credit method on the additional amount expected to be paid / availed as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the Balance Sheet date. Expense on non-accumulating compensated absences is recognized in the period in which the absences occur.

The Group recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit plan in its Balance Sheet as an asset or liability. Gains and losses through re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability / (asset) are recognized in other comprehensive income and are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. The actual return of the portfolio of plan assets, in excess of the yields computed by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation is recognized in other comprehensive income. The effect of any plan amendments is recognized in net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

# Provident fund

Eligible employees of Infosys receive benefits from a provident fund, which is a defined benefit plan. Both the eligible employee and the Company make monthly contributions to the provident fund plan equal to a specified percentage of the covered employee's salary. The Company contributes a portion to the Infosys Limited Employees' Provident Fund Trust. The trust invests in specific designated instruments as permitted by Indian law. The remaining portion is contributed to the government.

The weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 are as follows :

| Particulars                                              |   | Gratuity |      |         | Pension |         |

(1) For domestic defined benefit plan in India, the market for high quality corporate bonds being not developed, the yield of government bonds is considered as the discount rate. For most of our overseas defined benefit plan, given that the market for high quality corporate bonds is not developed, the Government bond rate adjusted for corporate spreads is used.

(2) The average rate of increase in compensation levels is determined by the Company, considering factors such as, the Company’s past compensation revision trends, inflation in respective markets and management’s estimate of future salary increases.

(3) Attrition rate considered is the Management’s estimate based on the past long-term trend of employee turnover in the Company. The tenure has been considered taking into account the past long-term trend of employees' average remaining service life which reflects the average estimated term of post-employment benefit obligation.

For domestic defined benefit plan in India, assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set in accordance with the published statistics by the Life Insurance Corporation of India. For overseas defined benefit plan, the assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set with regard to the latest statistics in life expectancy, plan experience and other relevant data.

The Group assesses all of the above assumptions with its projected long-term plans of growth and prevalent industry standards.

The Company contributes all ascertained liabilities towards gratuity to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust. In case of Infosys BPM and EdgeVerve, contributions are made to the Infosys BPM Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust and EdgeVerve Systems Limited Employees Gratuity Fund Trust, respectively. Trustees administer contributions made to the trust as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, and contributions for gratuity are invested in a scheme with the Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law. The plan assets of the overseas defined benefit plan have been primarily invested in insurer managed funds and the asset allocation for plan assets is determined based on the investment criteria prescribed under the relevant regulations applicable to pension funds and the insurer managers. The insurers' investment are diversified and provide for guaranteed interest rates arrangements.

Actual return on assets (including remeasurements) of the gratuity plan for the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 were ₹145 crore and ₹129 crore, respectively and for the pension plan were ₹36 crore and ₹(91) crore, respectively. The contributions for gratuity are invested in a scheme with the Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law.

# The details of major plan assets into various categories as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 are as follows:

sum upon retirement. The pension fund has defined rates for converting the lump sum to a pension and there is the risk that the members live longer than implied by these conversion rates and that the pension assets don’t achieve the investment return implied by these conversion rates.

Asset volatility: A proportion of the pension fund is held in equities, which is expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term but give exposure to volatility and risk in the short term. The pension fund board of insurer is responsible for the investment strategy and equity allocation is justified given the long-term investment horizon of the pension fund and the objective to provide a reasonable long term return on members’ account balances.

# The sensitivity of significant assumptions used for valuation of defined benefit obligation is as follows:

| Impact from                                              | As at March 31, 2024 |         |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------- |
|                                                          | Gratuity             | Pension |
| 1% point increase / decrease                             | 112                  | 43      |
| Weighted average rate of increase in compensation levels | 103                  | 7       |

Sensitivity to significant actuarial assumptions is computed by varying one actuarial assumption used for the valuation of the defined benefit obligation and keeping all other actuarial assumptions constant. In practice, this is not probable, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. The Group expects to contribute ₹335 crore to gratuity and ₹45 crore to pension during the fiscal 2025.

# The maturity profile of defined benefit obligation is as follows:

| Particulars               |      | Pension |   |   |
| ------------------------- | ---- | ------- | - | - |
| Equity                    | 2024 | 2023    |   |   |
| Bonds                     | 34   | 34      |   |   |
| Real estate / property    | 32   | 32      |   |   |
| Cash and cash equivalents | 26   | 26      |   |   |
| Other                     | 1    | 1       |   |   |
|                           |      | 7       | 7 |   |

| Particulars   | Gratuity | Pension |
| ------------- | -------- | ------- |
| Within 1 year | 316      | 62      |
| 1-2 years     | 311      | 67      |
| 2-3 years     | 338      | 65      |
| 3-4 years     | 417      | 70      |
| 4-5 years     | 444      | 65      |
| 5-10 years    | 2,122    | 332     |

These defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risk which are set out below:

Interest rate risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is generally calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to government bond yields and in certain overseas jurisdictions, it is calculated in reference to government bond yield adjusted for a corporate spread. If bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.

Life expectancy and investment risk: The pension fund offers the choice between a lifelong pension and a cash lump sum upon retirement. Infosys has an obligation to fund any shortfall on the yield of the trust’s investments over the administered interest rates on an annual basis. These administered rates are determined annually predominantly considering the social rather than economic factors. The actuary has provided a valuation for provident fund liabilities on the basis of guidance issued by the Actuarial Society of India.

| --------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Government of India (GOI) bond yield    | 7.00%                | 7.10%                |
| Expected rate of return on plan assets  | 8.20%                | 8.15%                |

| Expected guaranteed interest rate       | 8.25%                | 8.15%                |

(1) In India, the market for high quality corporate bonds being not developed, the yield of government bonds is considered as the discount rate. The tenure has been considered taking into account the past long-term trend of employees’ average remaining service life which reflects the average estimated term of the post-employment benefit obligations.

# The break-up of the plan assets into various categories as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is as follows :

| Particulars                                         | As at March 31, 2024 | As at March 31, 2023 |

The asset allocation for plan assets is determined based on the investment criteria prescribed under the relevant regulations. The actuarial valuation of PF liability exposes the Group to interest rate risk. The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a discount rate based on government bonds. If bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.

As at March 31, 2024, the defined benefit obligation would be affected by approximately ₹66 crore and ₹110 crore on account of a 0.25% increase / decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets.

The Group contributed ₹1,257 crore and ₹1,193 crore to the provident fund during the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively. The same has been recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss under the head employee benefit expense.

# 2.23 Reconciliation of basic and diluted shares used in computing earnings per equity share

Basic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the Group by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the Group by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per equity share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. The dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the equity shares been actually issued at fair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding equity shares). Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as at the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date. Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently for each period presented.

The number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any share splits and bonus shares issues including for changes effected prior to the approval of the financial statements by the Board of Directors.

A reconciliation of the equity shares used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per equity share is as follows:

# 2.24 Contingent liabilities and commitments

Accounting policy

Contingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity or a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

These matters are pending before various Income tax Authorities and the Management including its tax advisors expect that its position will likely be upheld on ultimate resolution and will not have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial position and results of operations.

# 2.24.2 McCamish Cybersecurity incident

In November 2023, Infosys McCamish Systems (McCamish), a step-down subsidiary of Infosys Limited, experienced a cybersecurity incident resulting in the non-availability of certain applications and systems. McCamish initiated its incident response and engaged cybersecurity and other specialists to assist in its investigation of and response to the incident and remediation and restoration of impacted applications and systems. By December 31, 2023, McCamish, with external specialists’ assistance, substantially remediated and restored the affected applications and systems. Loss of contracted revenues and costs incurred with respect to remediations, restoration, communication efforts, investigative processes and analysis, legal services and others amounted to $38 million (approximately ₹316 crore).

Actions taken by McCamish included investigative analysis conducted by a third-party cybersecurity firm to determine, among other things, whether and the extent to which company or customer data was subject to unauthorized access or exfiltration. McCamish also engaged a third-party eDiscovery vendor in assessing the extent and nature of such data. McCamish in coordination with its third-party eDiscovery vendor has identified corporate customers and individuals whose information was subject to unauthorized access and exfiltration. McCamish’s review process is ongoing. McCamish may incur additional costs including indemnities or damages / claims, which are indeterminable at this time.

On March 6, 2024, a class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against McCamish. The complaint arises out of the cybersecurity incident at McCamish initially disclosed on November 3, 2023. The complaint was purportedly filed on behalf of all individuals within the United States whose personally identifiable information was exposed to unauthorized third parties as a result of the incident.

# 2.24.3 Legal proceedings

Apart from this, the Group is subject to legal proceedings and claims, which have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Group’s management reasonably expects that such ordinary course legal actions, when ultimately concluded and determined, will not have a material and adverse effect on the Group’s results of operations or financial condition.

# 2.26 Segment reporting

Ind AS 108, Operating segments, establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments and related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The Group's operations predominantly relate to providing end-to-end business solutions to enable clients to enhance business performance. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) evaluates the Group's performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by business segments. Accordingly, information has been presented along business segments. The accounting principles used in the preparation of the financial statements are consistently applied to record revenue and expenditure in individual segments, and are as set out in the accounting policies.

Business segments of the Group are primarily enterprises in Financial Services and Insurance, enterprises in Manufacturing, enterprises in Retail, Consumer Packaged Goods and Logistics, enterprises in the Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services, enterprises in Communication, Telecom OEM and Media, enterprises in Hi-Tech, enterprises in Life Sciences and Healthcare and all other segments. The Financial services reportable segments has been aggregated to include the Financial Services operating segment and Finacle operating segment because of the similarity of the economic characteristics. All other segments represent the operating segments of businesses in India, Japan, China, Infosys Public Services and other enterprises in Public Services.

Revenue and identifiable operating expenses in relation to segments are categorized based on items that are individually identifiable to that segment. Revenue for 'all other segments' represents revenue generated by Infosys Public services and revenue generated from customers located in India, Japan and China and other enterprises in Public Services. Allocated expenses of segments include expenses incurred for rendering services from the Group's offshore software development centers and on-site expenses, which are categorized in relation to the associated efforts of the segment. Certain expenses such as depreciation and amortization, which form a significant component of total expenses, are not specifically allocable to specific segments as the underlying assets are used interchangeably. The Management believes that it is not practical to provide segment disclosures relating to those costs and expenses, and accordingly these expenses are separately disclosed as "unallocated" and adjusted against the total income of the Group.

Assets and liabilities used in the Group's business are not identified to any of the reportable segments, as these are used interchangeably between segments. The Management believes that it is currently not practicable to provide segment disclosures relating to total assets and liabilities since a meaningful segregation of the available data is onerous.

Business segment revenue information is collated based on individual customers invoiced or in relation to which the revenue is otherwise recognized.

Disclosure of revenue by geographic locations is given in Note 2.18, Revenue from operations.

Hence, in compliance with the Circulars, the AGM of the Company is being held through VC.
2. A member entitled to attend and vote at the AGM is entitled to appoint a proxy to attend and vote on his / her behalf and the proxy need not be a member of the Company. Since the AGM is being held in accordance with the Circulars through VC, the facility for the appointment of proxies by the members will not be available.
3. Participation of members through VC will be reckoned for the purpose of quorum for the AGM as per Section 103 of the Act.
4. Corporate members intending to authorize their representatives to participate and vote at the meeting are requested to send a certified copy of the Board resolution / authorization letter to the Scrutinizer by email to evoting@infosys.com with a copy marked to evoting@nsdl.com.

Infosys Limited    Notice of the 43ʳᵈ Annual General Meeting

6. Members whose shareholding is in demat mode are requested to notify any change in address or bank account details to their respective depository participant(s) (DP). Members whose shareholding is in physical mode are requested to opt for the Electronic Clearing System (ECS) mode to receive dividend on time in line with the Circulars. We urge members to utilize the ECS for receiving dividends. Please refer to point no. 16 for the process to be followed for updating bank account details.

7. Members may note that the Board, at its meeting held on April 18, 2024, has recommended a final dividend of ₹20/- per equity share for the financial year ended March 31, 2024 and additionally a special dividend of ₹8/- per equity share. The record date for the purpose of final dividend and special dividend is May 31, 2024. The final dividend and special dividend, once approved by the members in the ensuing AGM, will be paid on July 1, 2024, through various modes. To avoid delay in receiving dividend, members are requested to update their KYC with their depositories (where shares are held in dematerialized mode) and with the Company’s Registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA) (where shares are held in physical mode) to receive the dividend directly into their bank account on the payout date.

8. Members may note that the Income-tax Act, 1961, (“the IT Act”) as amended by the Finance Act, 2020, mandates that dividend paid or distributed by a company on or after April 1, 2020 shall be taxable in the hands of members. The Company shall therefore be required to deduct tax at source (TDS) at the time of making the payment of final and special dividend. To enable us to determine the appropriate TDS rate as applicable, members are requested to submit relevant documents, as specified in the below paragraphs, in accordance with the provisions of the IT Act.

For resident shareholders, taxes shall be deducted at source under Section 194 of the IT Act as follows:

| Members having valid Permanent Account Number (PAN) | 10%\* or as notified by the Government of India (GOI) |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Members not having PAN / valid PAN                  | 20% or as notified by the GOI                         |

*i) As per the Finance Act, 2021, Section 206AB has been inserted effective July 1, 2021, wherein higher rate of tax (twice the specified rate) would be applicable on payment made to a shareholder who is classified as ‘Specified Person’ as defined under Section 206AB of the Finance Act, 2021.

ii) As per Section 139AA of the IT Act, every person who has been allotted a PAN and who is eligible to obtain Aadhaar, shall be required to link the PAN with Aadhaar. In case of failure to comply with this, the PAN allotted shall be deemed to be invalid / inoperative and he shall be liable to all consequences under the IT Act and tax shall be deducted at the higher rates as prescribed under the IT Act.

However, no tax shall be deducted on the dividend payable to resident individual shareholders if the total dividend to be received by them during financial year 2024-25 does not exceed ₹5,000, and also in cases where members provide Form 15G / Form 15H (Form 15H is applicable to resident individual shareholders aged 60 years or more), subject to conditions specified in the IT Act. Resident shareholders may also submit any other document as prescribed under the IT Act to claim a lower / nil withholding of tax. PAN is mandatory for members providing Form 15G / 15H or any other document as mentioned above.

For non-resident shareholders, taxes are required to be withheld in accordance with the provisions of Section 195 and other applicable sections of the IT Act, at the rates in force. The withholding tax shall be at the rate of 20%** (plus applicable surcharge and cess) or as notified by the GOI on the amount of dividend payable. However, as per Section 90 of the IT Act, non-resident shareholders have the option to be governed by the provisions of the Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA), read with Multilateral Instrument (MLI) between India and the country of tax residence of the shareholders, if they are more beneficial to them.

For this purpose, i.e. to avail the benefits under the DTAA read with MLI, non-resident shareholders will have to provide the following:

- Copy of the PAN card allotted by the Indian income tax authorities duly attested by the shareholders or details as prescribed under rule 37BC of the Income-tax Rules, 1962
- Copy of the Tax Residency Certificate for financial year 2023-24 obtained from the revenue or tax authorities of the country of tax residence, duly attested by shareholders
- Electronic Form 10F as per notification no. 03/2022 dated July 16, 2022 issued by the Central Board of Direct Tax [Notification can be read under notification-no-3-2022-systems.pdf (incometaxindia.gov.in)]. Form 10F can be obtained electronically through the e-filing portal of the income tax website at https://www.incometax.gov.in/iec/foportal
- Self-declaration by the shareholders of having no permanent establishment in India in accordance with the applicable tax treaty
- Self-declaration of beneficial ownership by the non-resident shareholder
- Any other documents as prescribed under the IT Act for lower withholding of taxes, if applicable, duly attested by the shareholders

In case of Foreign Institutional Investors (FII) / Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPI), tax will be deducted under Section 196D of the IT Act at the rate of 20%** (plus applicable surcharge and cess) or the rate provided in relevant DTAA, read with MLI, whichever is more beneficial, subject to the submission of the above documents, if applicable.

** As per the Finance Act, 2021, Section 206AB has been inserted effective July 1, 2021, wherein the higher rate of tax (twice the specified rate) would be applicable on payment made to a shareholder who is classified as ‘Specified Person’ as defined under the provisions of the aforesaid Section. However, in case of a non-resident shareholder or a non-resident FPI / FII, the higher rate of tax as mentioned in Section 206AB shall not apply if such non-resident does not have a permanent establishment in India.

The aforementioned documents are required to be uploaded on the shareholder portal at https://www.infosys.com/investors/shareholder-services/dividend-tax.html on or before June 07, 2024.
