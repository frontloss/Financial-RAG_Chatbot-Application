# Remembering Mr. Tata

# Padma Vibhushan Ratan N Tata

28 December 1937 – 9 October 2024

It is with a profound sense of loss that we bid farewell to Mr. Ratan Naval Tata, a truly uncommon leader whose immeasurable contributions have shaped not only the Tata Group but also the very fabric of our nation.

For the Tata Group, Mr. Tata was more than a chairperson. He inspired by example. With an unwavering commitment to excellence, integrity and innovation, the Tata Group under his stewardship expanded its global footprint while always remaining true to its moral compass.

Mr. Tata’s dedication to philanthropy and the development of society has touched the lives of millions. From education to healthcare, his initiatives have left a deep-rooted mark that will benefit generations to come. Reinforcing all of this work was Mr. Tata's genuine humility in every individual interaction.

His legacy will continue to inspire us as we strive to uphold the principles he so passionately championed.

Letter from the Chairman

# Letter from the Chairman

The single most transformative force in 2024 was Generative AI. GenAI is not just another tech cycle—it is a civilizational shift. I believe every industry stands to benefit from GenAI.

TCS is proactively leading this change. We have systematically infused AI across our offerings and built intelligent agent solutions throughout the value chain. Looking ahead, we will deliver solutions through a human+AI model, invest in AI infrastructure and forge industry-best partnerships.

Dear Shareholders,

The financial year 2025 was a year of profound global disruption. Widespread geopolitical conflicts, military escalations, and uncertain trade dynamics severely impacted global supply chains. Over 60 nations went to the polls, stalling policy continuity and reform agendas across several key markets. As a result, businesses worldwide faced significant shocks—ranging from falling production volumes and rising costs to suboptimal asset utilization, impacting profitability and cash flows.

In the face of this turbulence, your company demonstrated exceptional resilience. We partnered closely with our clients to help them perform under pressure while accelerating their transformation agendas. By harnessing the power of Generative AI and other emerging technologies, we enabled our clients to prepare for the future. The range of transformation is multifaceted and truly profound.

For example, we worked with a client to develop a GenAI–based drug discovery solution that created over 1,300 molecules for a concept target, then assessed synthesizability and shortlisted 12 molecules undergoing in-vitro testing. For another client, we implemented a direct-to-consumer digital solution for the automotive industry, allowing a seamless omnichannel presence and customized vehicle ownership experience. In another case, we modernized 50 million lines of legacy code into a modern AI-powered architecture.

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Letter from the Chairman
These efforts, alongside many others, contributed to a robust financial performance, with FY 2025 revenue of US $30 billion and an industry-leading operating margin of 24.3%. Your company was once again recognized as a Global Top Employer for the tenth successive year.

The evolving geopolitical landscape and the emergence of a multipolar world are now reshaping how global businesses operate. We are witnessing the rise of new paradigms, demanding a thorough reimagination of systems, processes, and technologies to improve visibility, reduce costs, and enhance operational throughput. This reimagination includes designing end-to-end traceability across supply chains; diversification of sourcing strategies to build resilience, and region-specific ecosystems to serve decentralized markets.

Simultaneously, we are in the midst of an irreversible transition towards green energy. While jurisdictions vary in pace and regulation, businesses must adapt by developing market-appropriate solutions. Nowhere is this more evident than in the automotive sector. Investments in wind, solar, and small modular reactors (SMRs) are surging, leading to the development of new factories, supply chains, and digital tools that optimize both generation and consumption of energy. Your company has developed an AI-powered clever energy platform that has been helping clients optimize energy consumption, reducing emissions and energy costs.

I believe every industry stands to benefit from GenAI—and the IT industry is no exception. TCS is uniquely positioned to lead this transition. With our domain expertise, deep client relationships, and contextual knowledge, we are the ideal partner for enterprises seeking to build AI-first cultures, transform supply chains, navigate energy transitions, and build resilient and adaptive operations.

However, to lead in this new world, we too must continuously evolve. The path is clear: IT and business services are moving toward autonomous operations. Software development is being redefined by AI-led modernization, as legacy code is being transformed rapidly. Finally, agentic AI is being embedded deeply into enterprise systems.

TCS is proactively leading this change. We have systematically infused AI across our offerings and built intelligent agent solutions throughout the value chain. In 2025, we will have the largest AI-trained workforce in the industry and have launched our enterprise-grade GenAI platform: TCS WisdomNextᵀᴹ.

Looking ahead, we plan four distinct progressions. First, we establish a large pool of AI agents working alongside our human workforce. Second, we deliver solutions through a human+AI model. Third, we will consciously invest in AI data centers and cloud infrastructure. Fourth, we forge industry-best partnerships with hardware providers, solution innovators, and startups.

Yet, the single most transformative force in 2024 was Generative AI. Achieving near-human reasoning capabilities, GenAI is not just another tech cycle, it is a civilizational shift. Its widespread adoption is accelerating, powered by parallel advances in semiconductors, cloud computing, quantum technologies, robotics, and energy innovation. GenAI is already redefining analytics, customer experience, and marketing. The rise of autonomous robots and AI agents promises a future of ‘dark factories’ and AI-assisted enterprise functions.

This integrated approach will help us bring the best capabilities to every customer, ensuring they are future-ready, resilient, and competitive. We remain steadfastly committed to leading the industry with purpose, innovation, and responsibility.

Thank you for your continued trust and support as we shape the future, together.

Warm regards,
N Chandrasekaran
Chairman

# Letter from the CEO

Significant innovation is happening in the AI ecosystem across infrastructure, data platforms, models and AI native business applications. These innovations are forcing companies to invest in technology modernization and rapidly adopt AI to meet evolving customer expectations.

Our focus on innovation and growth drives us to continuously explore new technologies and business models, ensuring we stay ahead in an ever-evolving landscape.

Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to share that in FY 2025, we achieved two extraordinary milestones crossing the US$30 billion mark in revenues and the US$20 billion mark in brand value. This success is a testament to the early investments we have made in strengthening client relationships, building intellectual property, deepening employee capabilities and expanding technology ecosystem. I am grateful to every stakeholder for contributing to our growth and success.

In a very challenging geopolitical and macro-economic environment, the company reported an annual revenue of ₹255,324 crore in FY 2025, growing 6.0% year-on-year (4.2% in constant currency). Growth Markets experienced strong demand across key industries, fueled by accelerated digital adoption and new client acquisitions. Governments invested significantly in digital public services, creating opportunities for TCS to drive large-scale transformation.

Our disciplined execution and operational rigor stood out again, as we delivered industry-leading margins of 24.3%, even as we accelerated investments in talent and expanded capabilities. Our net margin was at 19.0%. Earnings per share were at ₹134.19, a growth of 5.1% over the prior year.

Our customer-centric focus and commitment to long-term value creation is well recognized by our clients. We were ranked #1 for customer satisfaction in Europe for the 12th year in a row. The number of clients spending over US$100 Mn annually, increased to 64 in FY 2025.

We saw TCV improvement across markets as clients prioritized initiatives around technology modernization, cost optimization, vendor consolidation, operating model transformation, and risk and compliance. We remain closely connected to our customers to help them navigate the challenges impacting their business.

Aarthi Subramanian has joined as President and Chief Operating Officer, working closely with me to help chart the future of our company. We are also pleased to welcome Mangesh Sathe as our new Chief Strategy Officer. Both Aarthi and Mangesh are seasoned, respected leaders whose expertise and vision will play a pivotal role in strengthening our growth journey, refining our organizational structure, and enhancing our operational excellence.

We are also partnering with Xerox in its re-invention strategy, accelerating its transition to a streamlined, services-led, and software-enabled organization. TCS will consolidate Xerox’s technology services to enhance business outcomes, migrate complex legacy data centers to the Azure public cloud, implement a cloud-based Digital ERP platform to revolutionize business processes, and integrate GenAI into operations to foster sustainable growth.

We remain steadfast in our commitment to delivering value to all stakeholders and setting new benchmarks in the IT services industry. Our focus on innovation and growth drives us to continuously explore new technologies and business models, ensuring we stay ahead in an ever-evolving landscape.

# Digital Transformation of Electoral Roll Management in India

For the Election Commission of India – the nation’s poll conducting body – elections start with the preparation of electoral rolls. Electoral rolls are the backbone of the election process. They are comprehensive lists maintained with stringent guidelines to ensure up-to-date information of electors. The Elector registration and form processing has been the core work of election officials across the nation for maximizing the citizen participation in the elections. Preparing electoral rolls is a meticulous process that involves identifying eligible electors, collecting data, verifying and making necessary corrections, and continuously updating the roll—and this must be done for hundreds of thousands of citizens, spread across remote villages, dense urban centers, and everything in between.

The application is pivotal for providing electoral information quickly to citizens. Electors can update and search their details using their Electoral Photo Identity Card (EPIC) or personal information. In addition, the voter information slip is generated from the application and handed to the electors by booth-level officers, providing all the necessary details about the elector and their polling station. TCS developed printing tool, has reduced the time to distribute electoral rolls and enhanced security of the electoral rolls data.

The election body collaborated with TCS and developed a flagship web-based application ERO Net 2.0, that revolutionized electoral roll management in India. The application managed end-to-end life cycle of electors, and was available nationwide. ERO Net 2.0 application has a centralized database that serves as the single source of truth for the election body. A standout feature is the executive dashboard, which is updated daily and offers a 360-degree view of the life cycle of electors.

As the primary technology partner, TCS helped the election body give a digital makeover to electoral roll management. The application that TCS developed was rolled-out nationwide within 7 months of launch, with complete functionalities and data migration. It allows over 1.05 million nationwide officials to handle elector registrations, updates, and deletions efficiently.

The application has been used to print over 25 crore EPICs and nearly 125 Crore voter information slips. Over 78 crore electors have been verified through house-to-house surveys. The application is making voting more accessible, more secure, and more inclusive for everyone.

# A journey towards becoming the most trusted advisor

Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), the nation’s largest bank, announced the separation of its wealth business, selling off its majority stake to a private equity firm, Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts (KKR). This marked the beginning of a new era for Colonial First State (CFS), which emerged as a fully independent entity.

When we needed to select a partner for our transformation program, we wanted to make sure obviously that we found the right capability. We selected TCS as a strategic partner for its almost perfect alignment to our culture - a culture of owning it, making a difference and being client obsessed.

Jeroen Buwalda

Chief Operating Officer

Colonial First State

CFS had to transition its entire IT estate, including the member-facing FirstChoice platform, to a CFS-controlled environment within an ambitious timeline. Compounding the complexity, many critical applications were owned by CBA, requiring CFS to build systems from scratch. Additionally, seamless management of over 30 vendors was essential to ensure uninterrupted service delivery and uphold the trust built over 30 years. To meet the evolving needs of its almost 1 million customers and advisors, CFS prioritized building a digital-powered, cloud-ready enterprise.

For over a decade, TCS has been a strategic partner to CFS, supporting numerous initiatives. To aid CFS in this transformative journey, TCS leveraged its innovation ecosystem, partnerships, thought leadership and proprietary solutions to craft a comprehensive transition roadmap. This collaborative approach delivered significant value to CFS. Additionally, TCS supported CFS in rebranding its website, boosting customer recall and brand equity.

# 79 Management Discussion and Analysis

# Overview of the Industry

The year 2024 began with signs of improved economic activity across major regions. The world GDP grew at a steady rate of 3.3%1. Despite divergent growth patterns across regions and sectors, the global technology landscape demonstrated unexpected stability.

However, in recent weeks, the global outlook has turned negative, as governments worldwide adjust their policy priorities, leading to unprecedented levels of uncertainty. The rapid escalation of trade tensions and extremely high policy uncertainty are anticipated to significantly impact global economic activity. Projections indicate that global growth will decline to 2.8% in 2025 and 3% in 20261. Amid these ongoing macroeconomic challenges, new discretionary projects requiring technology investments will face increased scrutiny and require stronger justifications for return on investment.

In 2025, enterprises will be accelerating adoption of AI into their digital core, to address technical debt and modernize legacy systems. This will require efforts in cloud migration, updating infrastructure frameworks and developing a strong data foundation. Enterprises also face a complex risk landscape with cybersecurity threats and geopolitical tensions, making them prime targets for cybercriminals due to their valuable intellectual property and customer data. Enterprises will continue to strengthen their cybersecurity management processes, leading to continued investments in security consulting services2.

TCS geographic footprint covers North America, Latin America, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Asia Pacific, India and Middle East Africa.

# Analysis of revenue growth and margin performance

On a reported basis, TCS’ revenue grew 6.0% in FY 2025, compared to 6.8% in the previous year. Despite increased macroeconomic uncertainty, the Company closed the year with a strong and resilient order book. During the year, clients prioritized initiatives around Technology modernization, Cost optimization, Vendor consolidation, Operating model transformation, Risk and Compliance. Ongoing delays and deferrals led to muted revenue growth in FY 2025.

EBIT margins were 24.3% in FY 2025, compared to 24.6% in the previous year. The 30-basis point decline was influenced by headwinds from merit-based interventions, including annual hikes, promotions, and investments in infrastructure and capability building. However, tailwinds such as improved utilization, productivity, and realization, along with favorable currency movements, contributed positively to the margins.

# Average currency exchange rates during FY 2025 for the three major currencies are given below:

| Currency | Weightage (%) | FY 2025 (₹) | FY 2024 (₹) | % Change YoY |
| -------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| USD      | 50.0          | 84.59       | 82.83       | 2.1          |
| GBP      | 14.7          | 108.26      | 104.07      | 4.0          |
| EUR      | 10.9          | 90.81       | 89.80       | 1.1          |

Movements in currency exchange rates through the year resulted in a positive impact of 1.8% on the reported revenue. The constant currency revenue growth for the year, which is the reported revenue growth stripped of the currency impact, was 4.2%.

# Business Outlook

Global growth is projected to be 2.8% in 2025 and 3.0% in 20267, significantly below the 3.7% average growth rate seen from 2000 to 2019. While global economic activity faces headwinds from geopolitical and policy uncertainties, there are opportunities for resilience and recovery. Clearer trade agreements and improved global cooperation could help regain momentum. However, risks like financial market volatility, demographic shifts, and fiscal constraints persist. Proactive policy responses and innovation-driven growth can help mitigate these pressures.

In this challenging environment, enterprises are expected to go through longer decision cycles and experience increased scrutiny on discretionary spending. Staying close to changing customer needs is essential to understanding both direct and indirect impacts. Businesses must embrace continuous transformation to stay resilient and shifting market dynamics call for the ability to anticipate change, adapt rapidly, and turn potential disruptions into strategic advantages.

Risk: The volatility of geo-political events and macroeconomic changes, like wars, adverse trade policies and continuing high inflation in major economies can impact client spending and also squeeze liquidity. TCS’ clients’ business outlook could be affected and in turn result in demand uncertainty for TCS’ services, and an increase in TCS’ cost of doing business. Risks to service delivery, business continuity, cybersecurity, sanctions compliance and human rights in geo-politically sensitive zones may increase costs and impact revenue growth.

Mitigation: Broad-based business mix with diversified focus across geographies and industry verticals and targeting CXO business in addition to CIOs aid in balancing the risk impact. Active monitoring of the changing geo-political landscape, ensuring business continuity plans and strengthening internal controls against secondary risks continue.

Risk: The global delivery model requires the mobility of the Company’s skilled professionals across the globe, and any regulatory restrictions in key markets can pose a threat. This may also have an impact on the cost of doing business and client project delays.

Mitigation: Promoting usage of Location Independent Agileᵀᴹ model with increased collaboration, material reduction in dependency on work visas through increased hiring of local talent and promoting local talent building in STEM areas helps to minimize this risk.

Risk: With new consumer patterns/behaviour unfolding, industries are evolving their business models. Some customers and segments may see restructuring initiatives, to adapt to newer markets, competition, mergers/acquisition, regulatory drivers and enhance efficiencies to create new business opportunities. This may result in an impact on the current services being provided.

Mitigation: Scanning future industry outlook for both business &#x26; technology for trends, capabilities &#x26; solutions, and providing pro-active, agile responses to drive transformation for the customer using differentiated offerings.

# Risk:

TCS’ global nature of operations requires it to be compliant with various privacy legislations like GDPR, DPDPA etc. carrying severe consequences for violations and data breaches. Privacy risks have increased with AI adoption getting democratized with the latest tools. Any violations or data breaches can have an impact on the Company’s business operations and its brand with material liabilities.

# Mitigation:

The global privacy policy supported by the Privacy governance framework PriVACE, organization structure with a Global Privacy Office and Geography level DPOs, embedding ‘Privacy by design’ in TCS’ solution/service delivery, risk based due diligence on third parties, data protection controls and audits across all its areas of operation ensure the risk is minimized. Keeping up to date with regulatory changes, training and awareness for all stakeholders and strong governance at regional and enterprise level has continuous focus.

# Risk:

Risks of cyber-attacks are on a constant rise and evolving quickly with far-reaching consequences. Attacks may emerge due to geo-political events, pandemic themed cyber threats etc. Security breaches could result in reputational damage, penalties, and legal and financial liabilities along with impact on business operations.

# Mitigation:

Investments in state-of-the-art security operations centre with automated playbooks; continued reinforcement of stringent security policies, procedures and controls (ISO 27001 certified), enterprise-wide training/awareness programs and communication with internal and external audits. Use of advanced AI/ML based tools to detect and prevent incursions with advanced quarantine capabilities, including perimeter security controls with enhanced internal vulnerability detection, data leak prevention tools, incident management and recovery process, red/purple teaming, “breach and attack” simulations in compliance with industry best practices are implemented.

# Internal Financial Control Systems and their Adequacy

B S R &#x26; Co. LLP, the statutory auditors of TCS, have audited the financial statements included in this Integrated Annual Report and have issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013).

TCS has aligned its systems of internal financial control in line with the globally accepted risk-based framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. This framework of internal financial controls meets the requirement of the Companies Act, 2013. The Internal Control – Integrated Framework (the 2013 framework) is intended to increase transparency and accountability in an organization’s process of designing and implementing a system of internal control. The framework requires a company to identify and analyze risks and manage appropriate responses. The Company has successfully laid down the framework and ensured its effectiveness.

TCS has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers Services LLP to oversee and carry out an internal audit of its activities. Design and operating effectiveness of process controls on financial transactions is also audited by an independent in-house internal audit team. The audit is based on an internal audit plan, which is reviewed each year in consultation with the statutory auditors and approved by the Audit Committee. In line with international practice, the conduct of internal audit is oriented towards the review of internal controls and risks in the Company’s operations such as software delivery, accounting and finance, procurement, employee engagement, travel, insurance, IT processes, including the subsidiaries and foreign branches.

TCS’ internal controls are commensurate with its size and the nature of its operations. These have been designed to provide reasonable assurance with regard to recording and providing reliable financial and operational information, complying with applicable statutes, safeguarding assets from unauthorized use, executing transactions with proper authorization and ensuring compliance with corporate policies. TCS has a well-defined delegation of power with authority limits commensurate with the responsibilities for approving engagements with all stakeholders that commit organizational resources and results in creation of assets and liabilities, income and expenditure.

TCS employs an advanced Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that connects all parts of the organization, to record data for accounting, consolidation and management information purposes. It has continued its efforts to align all its processes and controls with global best practices.

Based on its evaluation (as defined in Section 177 of the Companies Act, 2013 and Regulation 18 of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015), TCS’ Audit Committee noted that, as of March 31, 2025, the Company’s internal financial controls were adequate and operating effectively.

| Board effectiveness, independence and protection of minority shareholders’ interests | Board effectiveness is enhanced by setting a high bar in selecting the right mix of individuals to serve on the Board, with the right qualifications, expertise and experience, who can collectively serve the best interests of all stakeholders, maintain Board and management accountability and drive corporate ethics, values and sustainability. Profiles of Board of Directors are available at <https://www.tcs.com/who-we-are/leadership>. For greater diversity of opinions and perspectives within the Board, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee² has fostered diversity in terms of backgrounds, areas of expertise and:- Gender: Two out of the eight Directors (25%) are women;
- Nationality: Four nationalities represented – Indian, American, Danish and British;
- Industry: Technology, Banking, Energy, Transportation, Academia and Investment Banking.TCS’ policy on Appointment of Directors and Board Diversity can be found at <https://on.tcs.com/ApptDirectors>. Board independence is ensured by having an independent majority, with 5 Independent Directors out of 8 i.e., 62.5%. None of the Independent Directors is related to each other, or to the Non-Independent Directors. Average tenure of Independent Directors is 4 years. Board effectiveness is further enhanced by ensuring that none of the Directors hold directorships in more than seven listed entities, and the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director (“CEO & MD”) does not serve as an Independent Director in any listed company. TCS’ governance philosophy around minority shareholders’ interests is guided by the TCoC which emphasizes fairness and transparency to all stakeholders. Further, a qualified, diverse and independent Board ensures that minority shareholders’ interests are protected. TCS strives to reduce information asymmetry through transparency, extensive disclosures and detailed commentary of the demand environment and the state of the business, and material developments. The Company provides a variety of channels including a structured global investor outreach program, through which minority shareholders can interact with the management or the Board. Shareholders can communicate concerns and grievances to the Company Secretary’s office through a well-publicized channel, where complaints are tracked till closure. The Stakeholders’ Relationship Committee oversees the redressal of these complaints. |
| Avoidance of conflict of interest³                                                   | Chairmanship⁴ of the Board is a non-executive position, and separate from that of the CEO & MD. TCoC⁵ for non-executive directors and for independent directors carries explicit clauses covering avoidance of conflict of interest. Likewise, it explicitly prohibits any employee, including the executive directors, from accepting any position of responsibility, with or without remuneration, with any other organization without TCS’ prior approval. For the executive directors, such approval must be obtained from the Board.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Values, ethics and compliance⁶                                                       | Over the last five decades, TCS has consistently demonstrated very principled conduct and has earned its reputation for trust and integrity while building a highly successful global business. The Company’s core values are: Leading change; Integrity; Respect for Individual; Excellence; Learning and Sharing. The TCoC serves as a moral guide and a governing framework for responsible corporate citizenship. It sets out guidelines on various topics including respect for human rights, prohibition of bribery and corruption, recognition of employees’ freedom of association and avoidance of conflicts of interest. Every employee of the Company is required to sign the TCoC at the time of joining. Web-based annual refresher courses are mandated to ensure continued awareness of the Code. Further, frequent communications from the leadership reiterate the importance of the Company values and the TCoC. Customers are made aware of the TCoC principles in contract discussions and through inclusion of specific clauses in proposals and contracts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

# TCS’ Approach

Employees also undergo web-based mandatory training every year on Anti-bribery and ethical behaviour. They can raise ethics concerns on Ultimatix – the intranet portal of the Company, which are investigated and tracked to closure by the HR department. Employees and other stakeholders can also report any non-compliance to the TCoC or to the laws of the land by senior executives directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee under the Whistle blower Policy without fear of retaliation. Information about these channels is communicated to employees as part of the mandatory training modules.

Compliance to laws of the countries in which the Company operates, as well as global legislation such as Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Bribery Act, 2010, etc. are monitored through formal compliance procedures led by the Corporate compliance office. Changes to legislation are closely monitored, risks are evaluated and effectively managed across the business operations.

Governance, Risk and Compliance are overseen by the Compliance Officer, Chief Risk Officer and the Chief Human Resources Officer. The Audit Committee chaired by an Independent Director, also oversees compliance to the TCoC, Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy, Gift and Hospitality Policy and to the external regulations.

# Tax Strategy7

TCS is committed to complying with statutory tax obligations in all jurisdictions in which it operates in a responsible manner, and believes in reporting to the respective tax authorities, the relevant information that is complete and accurate, in a timely manner.

TCS does not engage in aggressive and contrived tax planning or tax structuring for the purpose of gaining tax advantages. TCS’ tax policy is to optimize the tax cost, avail tax incentives where available, while achieving 100% compliance with the letter as well as the spirit of the tax laws and regulations in all countries in which it operates. Compliance is achieved through a robust compliance reporting and monitoring process, with a strong governance on minimizing the tax risk. TCS has zero tolerance towards tax evasion, or the facilitation of tax evasion, by itself or by its employees or vendors.

TCS maintains open and collaborative relationships with governments and tax authorities worldwide. Where appropriate, TCS seeks advance clearance from tax authorities on the proposed tax treatment of transactions, helping pre-empt future disputes.

# Building sustainable and responsible supply chain

TCS requires its suppliers to sign the TCoC upon empanelment, that includes principles on protecting and safeguarding human rights, treating all persons with respect and dignity while safeguarding their rights, the abolition of forced and compulsory labour, child labour in the supply chain and strong corporate governance practices including anti-corruption and bribery and promoting fair business practices across the supply chain. TCoC also requires its suppliers to protect the environment and make conscious use of scarce natural resources in their business processes and at the same time highlighting the importance of health and safety in its workplace and expects the supplier to comply with sustainable business practices in letter and spirit in turn for its employees.

The Company supports the principles contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. It works with its suppliers to ensure that they too are fully aligned with these principles.

# Succession planning

TCS’ philosophy of empowering employees, its industry-leading talent retention, and a decentralized organization structure that devolves executive decision-making across all business units have resulted in a large and deep bench of leadership talent that enables robust succession planning and continuity and consistency in strategy. Succession planning for the top two leadership positions in each business unit is reviewed by senior management. Additionally, heads of business units carry out succession planning for key functions within their units.

Succession planning at senior management levels is reviewed by the Board. Business or unit heads are invited to present on specific topics at Board meetings from time to time, offering an opportunity to the directors to assess their values, competencies, and capabilities.

Remuneration policy of the Company is designed to create a high-performance culture. It enables the Company to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve results. The business model promotes customer centricity and requires employee mobility to address project needs.

The remuneration policy supports such mobility through pay models that are compliant to local regulations. In each country where the Company operates, the remuneration structure is tailored to the regulations, practices and benchmarks prevalent in the IT industry.

The Company pays remuneration by way of salary, benefits, perquisites and allowances (fixed component) and commission (variable component) to its Managing Director and the Executive Director(s). Annual increments are recommended by the NRC within the salary scale approved by the Board and Members and are effective April 1, each year.

The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the NRC, decides the commission payable to the Managing Director and the Executive Director(s) out of the profits for the financial year and within the ceilings prescribed under the Act, based on the Board evaluation process considering the criteria such as the performance of the Company as well as that of the Managing Director and each Executive Director.

Corporate Social Responsibility

The world is witnessing unprecedented advancements in technology, transforming the way we live, work, and contribute to society. Breakthroughs in AI, big data, blockchain, and digital connectivity have not only revolutionized industries but also redefined how organizations approach their responsibilities toward society and the environment. These technological breakthroughs are fostering a new paradigm, one where innovation and accountability go hand in hand.

The post-pandemic era has fundamentally reshaped the work environment, ushering in a new age of flexibility, innovation, and employee-centric practices. There is a requisite for businesses to adapt to change with the evident shift being towards more empathetic, responsive, and community-oriented initiatives.

TCS’ efforts extend beyond business outcomes, encompassing long-term societal impact through scalable, sustainable, and people-centric initiatives. This commitment is firmly embedded in TCS’ vision of empowering individuals and communities to become self-reliant, resilient, and future-ready. By integrating digital innovation with community engagement, TCS facilitates access to opportunities, knowledge, and tools that enhance socio-economic mobility, particularly among women, youth, and marginalized groups.

TCS continues to lead with purpose, leveraging technology as a force for good and reinforcing its role as a trusted partner to stakeholders and communities alike.

The role of businesses is no longer confined solely to economic value creation. There is a growing expectation for organizations to act as conscientious contributors to the greater social good. The transferal is towards fostering deeper engagement with communities, advocating for environmental stewardship, and promoting digital inclusion.

In this evolving landscape, organizations that thrive will be those that demonstrate resilience, foresight, and a commitment to responsible innovation. Organizations must not only navigate complexity with agility but also champion values that reflect the broader aspirations of society. In doing so, they contribute not just to industry leadership, but to a more sustainable, inclusive, and equitable future.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) recognizes that meaningful transformation lies at the intersection of innovation, human ingenuity, and responsible leadership. Guided by this philosophy, the organization actively harnesses emerging technologies to empower people and communities, connecting them to economic opportunities.

Over the past year, TCS’ programs and initiatives have created a lasting generational impact by empowering over 14.75 million people globally, particularly in areas where the need is high, and resources are the least. This ensued upward socio-economic mobility for 1.52 million people, building equitable and inclusive pathways for 1.27 million women, 390,690 youth, and 1.08 million people from marginalized groups. The achievement was made possible by scaling TCS’ high-impact programs across India and 50 countries worldwide, aligning them against four strategic themes (and 8 focus areas): provide a 21st century education for all (K-12 Education Literacy to Livelihood), help citizens equitably access job opportunities (Employment through Skilling, Digital Entrepreneurship), enable delivery of world-class front-line services in poorest districts (Healthcare, Digital).

The long-term evolution of responsible AI is dependent on those who shape its future-the next generation of innovators. In FY 2025, TCS’ Ignite My Future (IMF) program empowered 5,857 teachers to inculcate computational thinking while equipping 2,66,966 students across 6 continents with foundational skills for the AI era. TCS go Innovate Together (goIT) program now in its 16ᵗʰ year, has inspired 81,374 students across 50 countries to apply 21ˢᵗ Century Skills and latest technologies like AI, IoT, and App Design to solve real-world problems in their community with 51% of these students being girls and 79% from underrepresented minorities.

One of the biggest challenges in India is ensuring access to quality jobs for youth from socio-economically and geographically disadvantaged communities. TCS Youth Employment Program (YEP), now in its 15ᵗʰ year, addresses this challenge by equipping undergraduate students and unemployed graduates from disadvantaged rural communities with marketable skills, industry-relevant credentials, and valuable certifications. In FY 2025, 1,156 students have gained employment in the information technology sector and other domains through YEP.

Rural communities in India endure innumerable socio-economic challenges and have limited economic opportunities to operate in the digital economy. Launched over a decade ago, TCS BridgeIT program has empowered 1,712 active digital entrepreneurs of which 1,508 are women entrepreneurs, gearing up to be catalysts to strengthen the rural economy.

The program bridges the socio-economic divide in marginalized communities of India, focusing on women and youth by creating a network of rural digital entrepreneurs. Across 4,457 villages in rural India, these ‘digipreneurs’ are earning their livelihood while providing much needed last-mile services to 7,44,697 beneficiaries annually, such as access to citizen entitlements, banking, financial services, insurance, telehealth, telelaw, logistics, e-commerce and more. In FY 2025, BridgeIT’s latest project across Bihar, Jharkhand and Rajasthan onboarded 1,400 women and transformed 1,364 of them as digital entrepreneurs serving their villages.

For 25 years TCS Literacy as a Service (LaaS) program has addressed the challenge of illiteracy prevalent in India. The program has evolved to adapt to the emerging needs especially for marginalized communities. From functional literacy that included learning basic skills like reading, writing, arithmetic, the program now also offers digital and financial literacy, key citizen entitlement awareness and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). In FY 2025, the program served 4,12,121 marginalized women individuals leading to dignity and social inclusion.

TCS Hours of Purpose by Employees (HOPE) embodies a collective movement, by the people, for the people, fueled by the Tata group's enduring commitment to community service. The year saw 1,46,958 volunteers contribute over 8.93 million hours to support the poor with basic necessities, to create program partners, IMF creates awareness on probable job opportunities for students by bringing career pathways to life. IMF consistently engages with educators and students through the Learning Leaders network, family STEM nights, and special student projects.

# Shaping young minds through STEM

Globally, the gap between the skills required by employers and those possessed by job seekers is widening. The demand for professionals in STEM and computer science fields surpasses the number of qualified candidates available to fill these positions. TCS’ goIT is a digital innovation program and career readiness program that inspires students to pursue careers of the future by developing core skills.

To develop these future leaders, goIT uses a four-pronged model, layered with school district partnerships, which includes:

- In-person or virtual volunteer-driven engagements around the year
- goIT online connects, goIT monthly challenges centered around the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs)
- Mentorship by industry experts

To increase accessibility for students worldwide, goIT’s base curriculum was translated into 24 languages. Additionally, a revamped goIT monthly challenge, which offers year-round accessibility, an expanded selection of SDGs, and a redesigned challenge page enhancing engagement for students and facilitators were introduced.

# Clubes de Ciencia México

As part of this collaboration, IMF provided specialized training to all 87 instructors, equipping them with computational thinking strategies to enhance curriculum design of their workshops. This approach ensured that students not only gained scientific knowledge but also developed critical analytical skills.

Additionally, IMF facilitated meaningful connections between students and TCS volunteers, who guided them through complex STEM challenges designed to promote teamwork and problem-solving. In total, 708 students benefited during FY 2025 by this partnership.

To improve digital access, the goIT online platform is now available in Portuguese, in addition to English and Spanish. The platform was also launched in India to increase its scope. goIT continued expanding its technology offerings, introducing new pathways in Cybersecurity and Data Science. Additionally, an AI Suite, featuring Machine Learning and Generative AI, was launched to equip students with emerging tech skills. goIT's Microprocessor Suite now includes Arduino boards and Raspberry Pi, complementing the program’s existing Micro:bit tools for hands-on prototyping.

By fostering curiosity, innovation, and collaboration, IMF continues to shape the next generation of STEM leaders, proving that knowledge and mentorship can transform lives. Since its launch in 2009, goIT has positively impacted 351,078 students in its growing presence across 51 countries. In FY 2025, goIT empowered 85,668 students and educators around the world.

# Youth Employment Program (YEP)

# Inspiring young minds: Innovation through technology

In Japan, elementary and junior high school education is mandatory, ensuring that all children aged 6 to 15 attend school. While the national curriculum provides a strong foundation, students often have interests that extend beyond standard subjects. To bridge this gap, TCS has leveraged its IT expertise to develop engaging educational initiatives like the TCS’ goIT program, designed to spark curiosity and enthusiasm for technology among upper elementary students.

Youth unemployment, particularly among marginalized communities, is a pressing challenge in modern India. Limited opportunities, inadequate communication skills, and a lack of technical expertise hinder youth employment prospects and their ability to thrive in the digital economy.

TCS’ YEP addresses this challenge through its transformative “Teach, Coach, Mentor, and Place” model. The program aims at upskilling youth from marginalized communities across the country, making them industry-ready and supporting them with placement opportunities. In collaboration with industry leaders and subject matter experts, YEP delivers comprehensive training in business communication, aptitude, computer programming, and domain-specific skills.

As part of this program, students participated in design thinking modules, tackling the pressing issue of global warming. They explored its severe consequences and brainstormed innovative IT-driven solutions to mitigate its impact. Each group then presented their ideas to peers and teachers, often making their first formal presentations. Through multiple practice sessions, they refined their delivery, building confidence and communication skills.

Beyond deepening their understanding of global warming, this hands-on experience fostered critical thinking, teamwork, and creative problem-solving, empowering students to envision how technology can drive real-world change.

# Prime Minister Internship Scheme (PMIS)

This year, we had the opportunity to hold a design thinking class for the first time. Our class included a wide range of students - those who tended to be disruptive, those who were distracted by tablets, and those who struggled to fully understand Japanese. Despite these challenges, all 90 students stood proudly to deliver their presentations, leaving both myself and the homeroom teachers deeply moved.

TCS is proud to have partnered with the Government of India, towards the larger nation building exercise, through the PMIS. The program aims to equip the youth with hands-on experience, industry exposure, and in-demand skills, contributing to employment generation across sectors.

The interns experience a structured 12-month internship program, comprising four months of intensive Soft Skills training, followed by eight months of on-the-job learning. For the Soft Skills phase, a specially curated program by name SAFAL (Sashaktikaran, Aatmanirbharta, Falta, Avsar, Lakshya), an extension of YEP, has been implemented to train the PMIS interns. This initiative is jointly executed by the TCS CSR – YEP team and the Academic Alliances Group (AAG), with mentorship from business unit experts and senior leaders across TCS.

The classes provided by TCS Japan allowed us to witness the growth of our students firsthand. Thank you for giving our children this valuable experience.

# Breaking barriers: Jeba Malar’s journey to success

Jeba Malar, hailing from the small town Sattur, comes from a humble family of six, where her father is the breadwinner and her mother supports the household with tireless effort and unwavering dedication. Rural communities in India face numerous socio-economic challenges, including limited job access and lack of awareness of Government, financial, and online services thus restricting economic opportunities for generations. Poor infrastructure, limited resources, and technological gaps further hinder their participation in the digital economy. TCS BridgeIT program addresses the socio-economic divide in marginalized communities of India, especially among women and the youth, by creating rural digital entrepreneurs. The program bridges the digital divide, builds a rural entrepreneurship ecosystem and enables social integration.

As the eldest of four siblings, Jeba always dreamed of improving her family’s financial situation and ensuring a brighter and more secure future for her younger siblings. She pursued her graduation in Physics Honors from Sri S. Ramasamy Naidu Memorial College, but the challenges of securing a stable job in an increasingly competitive world seemed both overwhelming and daunting. This all changed when Jeba participated in TCS YEP, an opportunity that would transform her life. Through YEP, she received comprehensive training in business communication, interview skills, aptitude, problem-solving, and teamwork. Beyond enhancing her technical and professional abilities, the program instilled in her the confidence to take on real-world challenges. Equipped with these skills, Jeba was shortlisted for an interview at Tata Power, where she excelled, attributing her success to the rigorous preparation she received through YEP. Today, she proudly contributes to her family’s income and ensures her siblings have access to quality education. Grateful for the empowerment YEP provided, Jeba stands as a testament to how knowledge, determination, and the right opportunities can change lives.

BridgeIT equips citizens from marginalized communities with the skills, technology, mentorship, and resources required to set up a Digital Service Centre and provide essential services. These ‘digipreneurs’ use information technology to help others in the local community avail Government entitlements by providing financial and digital services in education, employment, and adult literacy. BridgeIT capitalizes on VLC (Village Livelihood Committee), a social safety net which helps to identify and support budding entrepreneurs; and DEEco (Digital Entrepreneur Ecosystem) which fosters sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystems, facilitates diverse business ventures and promotes economic growth. Personalized learning was delivered using the TCS DELI (Digital Entrepreneur Learning Intervention) framework that indirectly assesses deeper learning needs while mentorship from experienced entrepreneurs was leveraged using the “Didi ka Darbar” platform. TEN (TCS Entrepreneurs Networks) platform helped entrepreneurs connect.

Inadequate adult literacy remains a significant challenge, hindering India’s ability to achieve its full economic potential. A substantial portion of the non-literate population consists of women and marginalized communities. TCS’ LaaS promotes social inclusion and transforms lives through literacy. It leverages algorithmic learning paths, cloud-based personalized vernacular content, and AI technology to address the significant adult literacy gap in India. LaaS aims to empower non-literates, such as women who form much of the non-literate population, in their native languages.

Equipped with training and resources from BridgeIT, Priyanka started her entrepreneurial journey. She used the laptop given and invested in a printer to start serving her community. She started by offering essential digital services such as Aadhaar updates, resume creation, and digital photography. With continuous support from online training sessions, mentoring, and the digital handbook, she gradually expanded her services to include cash withdrawals, a high demand service in her village.

Beyond supporting her community with easy access to digital solutions, Priyanka saw a significant increase in her income, strengthening her family’s financial stability.

TCS partners with NGOs, state literacy departments, and rural livelihood missions to reach those in need. Since its inception, LaaS has empowered over 2.61 million beneficiaries and 2,41,740 facilitators. In FY 2025, LaaS empowered 4,12,216 learners.

# Prabhasini Baral's journey to financial independence: Turning dreams into reality

Prabhasini Baral, from Palli village, had always dreamed of earning her own living but lacked formal education. When she heard about LaaS classes at the village community center from a friend, she seized the opportunity.

Guided by the 17 UN SDGs, HOPE provides skill-based and interest-based opportunities, empowering TCS’ diverse workforce to make a real impact. Over 380 volunteering events have been unified under a single platform, allowing employees to choose how, where, and with whom they volunteer, making TCS a leading company for employee volunteering.

HOPE projects are overseen and driven by ‘Purpose Councils’ comprising leaders who believe in the Tata Ethos of caring for the community. HOPE fosters a purpose-driven ecosystem designed for long-term, sustainable change.

Starting with the basics, learning the alphabet and arithmetic, Prabhasini gained confidence. She also discovered the power of knowledge beyond literacy, learning about disaster preparedness and the importance of essential documents like a bank passbook, Aadhaar card, and PAN card.

With her newfound skills, Prabhasini applied for the Subhadra Yojana scheme using her mobile phone and secured financial assistance. Investing wisely, she purchased a cow, and today, she earns a steady income by selling milk in her village, turning a simple resource into a sustainable livelihood.

Her success was further fueled by LaaS’ collaboration with Tata Sustainability Group (TSG) and the Youth Council for Development Alternatives (YCDA). This initiative, dedicated to uplifting those affected by Cyclone Fani in Puri, Odisha, empowered Prabhasini and many others with LaaS’ five literacy offerings. Several women beneficiaries, part of Self-Help Groups (SHG), have enrolled under the Mission Shakti scheme which helps them achieve socio-economic independence. Today Prabhasini stands as a beacon of hope, proving that with knowledge and determination, dreams can turn into reality.

# Tech4HOPE: Driving sustainable change for non-profits

Juliet Peters

Project Manager, Canada.

TCS Tech4HOPE is a skill-based employee volunteering program that harnesses technology to redefine how non-profits serve their communities. Through this initiative, TCS collaborates with non-profit organizations to deliver pro bono advisory and technology consulting services that generate sustainable impact. By providing the tools to adopt technology, Tech4HOPE empowers organizations to broaden their reach and achieve lasting self-sufficiency.

My social wellbeing journey started early in life during my travels to one of the premiere spiritual organizations in West Bengal. We had close ties with this institute, and growing up, I participated in many events organized by their monks. When I joined TCS, my social venture continued. From fundraising for education to supporting a needy mother for her dialysis, I could always count on my colleagues to rise to the occasion.

During the pandemic, I worked with a non-profit engaging in the wellbeing of HIV positive children and was touched by their passion, honesty and humility. Since then, I’ve been supporting them and would like to help them expand a set-up that employs HIV positive young adults, post institutional care. In the United States, TCS offered long-term pro bono support to Sports Integrity Global Alliance (SIGA), a multi-stakeholder coalition working to bring the global sports industry together around its set of Universal Standards on Sport Integrity. TCS volunteers dedicated more than 850 hours towards building a tailored Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform from scratch, ensuring SIGA’s capacity to combat corruption and strengthen sport integrity. With its new CRM tool, SIGA is now better equipped to improve efficiency, nurture relationships, and expand both its membership and its number of committed supporters.

During a recent visit, one of TCS’ customers visited them and was greatly impressed. I promote the volunteerism spirit within the unit. Recently, the entire unit contributed whole-heartedly towards Wayanad relief work. I admire my team for their active volunteering towards causes that matter.

continued with the TCS Digital Empowers Sustainathon, developed with a client partner, to support the non-profit organization Human-I-T. Additionally, the initiative embarked on two deep research projects, generating insights and recommendations for long-term, system level improvements. Some of the trends identified by the group include the slow pace of Government and higher education as they try to keep up with technology’s evolution, immigration, deglobalization and the movement toward micro-credentialing. Proposed solutions, published by Digital Empowers and its partner in December 2024, included recommendations for big businesses to lead digital skilling efforts, for more collaboration between institutions offering micro-credentials and employers posting actual jobs, for shifting Government regulation and assessment from its oversight of individual courses to regulation of the digital skilling organizations themselves, and more.

In India, Digital Empowers facilitated collaboration between Tata group companies, key social development organizations, and Government agencies. These efforts aligned with CSR programs through the event series:

- Pathways to Prosperity: Strengthening Digital and Financial Skills in India
- Driving Women’s Economic Participation in STEM
- Bridging the Digital Divide for People with Disabilities
- Future Forward: Digital Entrepreneurship for Rural Women

This culminated in the pan-India celebration, Empowering Women, Inspiring India, marking International Women’s Day with a series of events across ten TCS offices. The initiative brought together nearly 2,500 employees, business leaders, and beneficiaries from TCS CSR programs. Women from CSR initiatives—including TCS support staff and young professionals from LaaS and YEP—spoke about how gaining education, digital skills, and employment shaped their journeys. Partners and participants from goIT, IMF, and BridgeIT also shared their perspectives. Senior business leaders and Delivery Center Heads joined, reflecting strong collaboration. Empowering Women, Inspiring India was a meaningful reminder that investing in women’s empowerment strengthens communities and TCS.

In FY 2025, Digital Empowers established 9 cross-sector partnerships, engaged 4,065 participants across 24 events and 22 client engagements.

DISQ organized the two-day Buildathon 1.0 event with a partner which focused on decentralized AI. The event hosted a diverse group of around 300 innovators, mentors, Government officials, delegates and renowned speakers who shared insights. The event reinforced the commitment to driving innovation through decentralized AI and collaboration.

TCS has provided an integrated Hospital Management System (HMS) and IT infrastructure, which includes a comprehensive and fully integrated web-based solution, to The Cancer Institute (CI), Chennai. TCS has implemented a HMS at Tata Medical Center (TMC), Kolkata. CI and TMC are the largest and one of the first Cancer Care institutes in Southern and Eastern India.

At the two-day Zero Conference India, at Delhi in September 2024, DISQ was selected from fifteen solutions globally as a Global Scaling Solution Fellow. Along with the core team, innovators from two DISQ startup teams had the opportunity to present their offerings.

In addition, DISQ was privileged to share the stage with changemakers as a panel speaker during the Bengaluru Tech Conference hosted by EnAble India and Zero Project which brought innovators together, such as a DISQ incubated startup. The session provided a platform for DISQ to share its aspirations, articulate what makes it unique in the incubation ecosystem and explore how the DISQ model can be scaled beyond India.

In FY 2025, DISQ has nurtured and supported multiple startups, positively impacting the lives of over 102,011 beneficiaries.

# Health and wellness

TCS recognizes the importance of health and wellness and promotes it among its employees as well as in local communities across the world. Its CSR initiatives seek to create new, systemic solutions that address society’s biggest health challenges.

The recent landslides in Wayanad triggered by relentless monsoon led to widespread soil erosion and landslides, destroying homes, farmland and critical infrastructure. Among the most affected were the tribal communities, where families faced the loss of shelter and security as their homes were either partially or fully destroyed.

The ONE Tata response to this calamity united Tata group companies to deliver essential support and address the long-term needs of those affected. TCS is contributing to the financial support required to meet the project course, over the next three years.

2. a. Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing⁴²? (Yes/No)

Yes. TCS Global Policy on Responsible Sourcing was released internally, during FY 2025 which combines the two existing policies a) TCS Green Procurement and b) TCS Sustainable Supply Chain Policy. This policy details out the topics under Labour, Human rights, Ethics, Environment and Sustainable Procurement. Additionally, this policy aligns with various ESG frameworks and regulatory requirements.

b. If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?

All suppliers having a contract agreement with TCS are required to abide by the TCS’ Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC), Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) requirements for contractors and the applicable policies. In addition to this about 23.8% of suppliers have been assessed in FY 2025 on sustainability pillars including Labour, Human rights, Ethics, Environment and Sustainable Procurement through a Sustainable Supply Chain Assessment Platform.
3. Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste⁴³.

This is not relevant to TCS global operations as the Company is primarily an IT services organization providing software services.

As the Company provides software services through its office-based operations, it procures off-the-shelf items or products, which after their end of life are disposed of as per sustainable waste management practices. This is in line with the concept of circularity through waste minimization, segregation, reuse, recycling, and eco-friendly disposal according to regulatory requirements and industry best practices.

No. This is not applicable to TCS as the Company primarily provides software services.

# Leadership Indicators

# 1. Has the entity conducted Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) for any of its products (for manufacturing industry) or for its services (for service industry)? If yes, provide details in the following format?

No. TCS is primarily an IT services organization and products, if any, are typically software products. Hence the applicability of life-cycle approach to TCS’ core operations is rather limited. Application of a life cycle approach is hence restricted to the services and products procured by TCS for its own operations. Most of the product categories procured are off-the-shelf items. Hence, the life cycle philosophy as extended to these include green procurement considerations as a part of the technical specifications for purchase and end-of-life management to maximize recycling.

# 2. If there are any significant social or environmental concerns and/or risks arising from production or disposal of your products/services, as identified in the Life Cycle Perspective/Assessments (LCA) or through any other means, briefly describe the same along-with action taken to mitigate the same⁴⁴.

TCS is a provider of IT consulting services and business solutions. No social or environmental concerns are associated with the use of its offerings. Details of the environmental footprint of TCS’ operations and mitigation steps are provided as part of disclosures under Principle 6.

• At TCS, remuneration is same for men and women working full-time, in the same grade, in the same role, and at the same location, and with the same level of experience⁶⁷. Where relevant, the Company publishes the raw mean and median pay differences between genders (not normalized for part-timers or grade and role differences) on its own website as well as on public sites. Gaps in median salary between genders is due to different proportion of men and women across experience levels and grades. TCS’ focused equal-opportunity employment programs are expected to narrow this gap over time.

• KMP includes CEO &#x26; MD, CFO, CS, erstwhile Chief Operating Officer &#x26; ED and erstwhile CS.

# PRINCIPLE 6: Businesses should respect and make efforts to protect and restore the environment

# Environmental Sustainability at TCS:

TCS has embraced the precautionary principle and recognized carbon footprint mitigation and environmental protection along with resource optimization as a key priority area. It is driven by the belief that sustainability-driven decisions are essential to business success. TCS’ Environmental Sustainability Policy articulates this vision and mission. The Stakeholder Relationship Committee oversees the carbon and environmental strategy and performance, demonstrating strong commitment at senior-most levels of the organization.

TCS is certified to ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management System (EMS) standard across 129 of its facilities worldwide in FY 2025. These certified locations constitute 82% of office footprint and 87% of people footprint operating from these locations. In FY 2025, 33% of ISO 14001 certified TCS locations underwent external/third party audits. TCS has induction training for all new employees on Environmental Sustainability. In addition to this, an Environmental Sustainability Web Based Training (WBT) program is mandatory for all employees which includes topics such as Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs), energy and climate change, water conservation, waste management, biodiversity, responsible consumerism, design thinking for sustainability and what TCS is doing in the field of environmental sustainability. This training is followed by bi-annual refresher training and assessment. In FY 2025, 98% employees were compliant with the mandatory training requirement.

# Essential Indicators

1. Details of total energy consumption (in Joules or multiples) and energy intensity, in the following format:

Electricity from the grid is the most significant form of energy for TCS. Over the years, TCS has increased the share of Renewable Electricity (RE) through “green-tariff” schemes offered by the state electricity providers, onsite rooftop solar generation and procurement from third party producers in India and procurement of Energy Attribute Certificates (EAC). The renewable energy consumption as a percentage of total energy consumption has increased from 74% in FY 2024 to 79% in FY 2025. The renewable electricity attributed to 85% of total electricity consumption during the year. Electricity consumption across TCS operations increased by 11% YoY on account of increased operations due to return to office and inclusion of additional locations in the reporting boundary. There is a 4.3% increase in overall electricity consumption due to inclusion of additional locations in the reporting boundary. Other sources of energy include natural gas (mainly used for space heating/cooling, district heating and cooling, mostly in overseas geographies), fuel used in company owned vehicles, cooking gas used in cafeteria and diesel used in diesel generators (mainly used as a back-up source during power shortages).

# Commitment to Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)

TCS has committed to SBTi and the Near-Term Targets are given below. SBTi has classified TCS’s scope 1 and 2 target, in line with a 1.5°C trajectory.

- TCS commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 90% by FY 2030 from a FY 2016 base year.
- TCS also commits to reduce absolute scope 3 emissions 35% by FY 2034 from a FY 2020 base year.

To achieve these targets, the green-house gas management approach has four key levers – green infrastructure, green IT, IT-enabled operational efficiencies, and renewable energy.

# Green Infrastructure and IT enabled operational efficiency:

All new campuses owned by TCS are designed according to green building standards for energy and resource efficiency. They have roof-top solar photovoltaic installations to reduce the carbon footprint. The total built-up area occupied by TCS has increased YoY from 38.2 million sq.ft. to 40.6 million sq.ft. in FY 2025. With the increasing footprint, TCS is committed to expand consciously its green footprint, to align with its sustainability goals. In FY 2025, TCS got Platinum IGBC certification for 2 additional buildings and Gold certification for 3 additional buildings. The green certified area in India has increased from 67.3% to 71% over the total built-up area. This accounts for 45 TCS offices and campuses with over 28.8 million sq.ft. of area under certified green building by Indian Green Building Council.

During the year, several initiatives were aligned to achieve the carbon targets which included those in building and IT infrastructure. Initiatives in building infrastructure included energy efficiencies in HVAC systems, Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) and chillers. The specific initiatives are as below:

- HVAC system upgradation by installation of latest technology VRF systems which works on inverter technology.
- Use of High Efficiency VFD based chillers.
- Replacement of R-22 based and fixed compressor-based HVAC equipment with inverter technology-based equipment.
- Modular UPS which can modulate its capacity based on load and helps provide 90-95% efficiency, even at lower loads.
- Life cycle-based replacement of HVAC equipment like chillers, pumps and cooling towers has helped reduce TCS’ energy consumption.
- Energy optimization in the Company’s operations through IoT based solutions, remote monitoring, analytics and automated feedback mechanism.
- As a commitment to energy conservation and management, the Company has continued to implement initiatives, monitor and measure energy performance at 22 of TCS’ ISO 50001:2018 certified campuses in India, conducted internal audits at 100% of the certified campuses and have undertaken external audits by TUV Nord for continuing TCS’ certification to Energy Management Systems (EnMS).

# Green IT:

Initiatives in Green Information Technology (Green IT) focused on data center and IT device consolidation and optimization to reduce the carbon footprint. The areas covered under green IT initiatives include IT energy optimization in data centers and equipment rooms. TCS’ data centers have a weighted average PUE of 1.59 (FY 2025) compared to PUE of 1.7 (FY 2024). Apart from the two main data centers, TCS also has 54 equipment rooms for business as usual (BAU) activities, wherein the weighted average PUE was 1.79 in FY 2025. TCS data centres use 100% RE. The total power consumed by TCS data centers was 6.6 GWh during the reporting year.

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Business Responsibility &#x26; Sustainability Report

FY 2025. In addition to the above, green attributes are considered in every IT asset procurement. TCS’ IoT-based Real-time Energy Management System (TCS Clever Energy™) initiative involves real time monitoring to optimize the operational energy efficiency across all offices. The smart, scalable, analytics driven IoT solution uses TCS Connected Universe Platform (TCUP) IoT platform, which forms the backbone, enabling visualization of data acquired from various locations and facilities’ energy meters and sensors. Other energy optimization initiatives include:

- IT Equipment optimization (rack consolidation, server consolidation and procurement of energy efficient devices)
- UPS optimization (right sizing of UPS, replacement of old technology UPS with modular UPS)
- Cooling optimization (switching off excess capacity cooling units, maintaining return set temperature at 24 +/- 1° C, replacing old with new technology cooling units)
- Leakage reduction (proper alignment of racks and perforated tiles, partitioning to reduce cooling area, cold aisle containment, blanking panel, active tiles and soft partitioning)

# Renewable Energy:

The roof top solar photovoltaic installations this year remained at 10.2 MWp contributing to 2.7% of total electricity use in FY 2025. The Company continued its procurement of renewable energy through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), switching over to green tariffs and procurement of Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs). The onsite solar generation and renewable energy procurement have resulted in an increase in renewable energy use to 79% of total energy use.

# 9. Provide details related to waste management by the entity, in the following format⁷⁹:

TCS is primarily an IT services and consulting organization, and therefore does not use any hazardous or toxic chemicals in its core processes. The Company has office or facility operations, and the waste is generated from the auxiliary processes used to run these facilities. Based on the nature of its services, TCS’ facilities mostly generate electronic, electrical, and municipal solid waste. Potentially hazardous and regulated wastes such as lead-acid batteries and waste lube oil are generated in relatively smaller proportions which are disposed through government-approved recyclers as per regulations. E-waste is disposed to government approved e-waste recyclers.

TCS is committed to sustain the best practices that have already been institutionalized like segregation of all recyclable wastes, 100% compliance to management practices for regulated wastes like hazardous and e-waste and maximizing recycling of office papers, packaging paper and plastics. TCS focuses on elimination of single-use plastics to ensure that the impact on environment and ecosystems is minimal. E-waste is one of key wastes generated from Company’s facilities and the Company has a process to manage and handle e-wastes at TCS. TCS follows a stringent process for conducting due diligence prior to finalizing an authorized e-waste disposal/recycling vendor. TCS facilities ensure safe disposal of the e-waste to the authorized recycler as per regulatory requirement in respective geographies.

All TCS campuses, owned offices and leased offices that have available space are provided with on-site food waste management facilities such as biodigesters and organic waste converters (OWCs) and garden waste is treated by vermicomposting at TCS campuses where feasible. TCS targets to achieve Zero Waste to Landfill (ZWL) for all TCS’ campuses by 2030 and plans to maximize the recycling and reuse of all waste categories to divert waste away from landfill.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Our responsibilities” section of our report.

# Other information

The Company’s management and the Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Company’s Integrated Annual Report (but does not include the BRSR Core attributes and assurance report thereon).

Additionally, we have performed a limited assurance engagement on select BRSR and GRI indicators and issued an independent assurance report on 27 May 2025. Our report thereon is included with the other information.

Our reasonable assurance opinion on the BRSR Core attributes does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our assurance report of the BRSR Core attributes, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the BRSR Core attributes, our knowledge obtained in the assurance, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this reasonable assurance report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Intended use or purpose

The ISI and our reasonable assurance report are intended for users who have reasonable knowledge of the BRSR Core attributes, the reporting criteria and ISI and who have read the information in the ISI with reasonable diligence and understand that the ISI is prepared and assured at appropriate levels of materiality.

Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

# Management’s responsibilities for the identified Sustainability Information (ISI)

The management of the Company acknowledges for:

- designing, implementing and maintaining internal controls relevant to the preparation of the ISI that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;

Inherent limitations

The preparation of the Company’s BRSR information requires the management to establish or interpret the criteria, make determinations about the relevance of information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported information.

Measurement of certain amounts with respect to the BRSR Core metrics, some of which are estimates, is subject to substantial inherent measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG Footprint, Water Footprint, Energy Footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to support our opinion does not reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics.

Our responsibilities

We are responsible for:

- Planning and performing the engagement to obtain reasonable assurance on the sustainability disclosures in the BRSR Core are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria in line with the section above;
- Forming an independent opinion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained; and
- Reporting our reasonable assurance opinion to the Board of Directors of the Company.

Summary of the work we performed as the basis for our opinion

We exercised professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the engagement. We designed and performed our procedures to obtain evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable assurance opinion.

The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depended on our judgement, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the ISI covered by reasonable assurance, whether due to fraud or error. We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement through understanding the ISI covered by reasonable assurance and the engagement circumstances. We also obtained an understanding of the internal control relevant to the ISI covered by reasonable assurance in order to design procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls. In carrying out our engagement, we:

- assessed the suitability of the criteria used by the Company in preparing the ISI covered by reasonable assurance;
- evaluated the appropriateness of reporting policies, quantification methods and models used in the preparation of the ISI covered by reasonable assurance and the reasonableness of estimates made by the Company; and
- evaluated the overall presentation of the ISI covered by reasonable assurance.

Exclusions

Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we do not express an opinion on the same:

- Any form of review of the commercial merits, technical feasibility, accuracy, compliance with applicable legislation for the project. We are not required to verify any of the judgements and commercial risks associated with the project, nor comment upon the possibility of the financial projections being achieved.
- The Company’s statements that describe the strategy, progress on goals (other than those listed under the scope of assurance), expression of opinion, claims, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim to future intention provided by the Company, and assertions related to Intellectual Property Rights and other competitive issues.
- Operations of the Company other than those mentioned in the “Scope of Assurance”.
- Aspects of the BRSR and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the ISI.
- Data and information outside the defined reporting period i.e., from 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025.

# Independent Auditor’s Report

To the Members of Tata Consultancy Services Limited

# Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited (hereinafter referred to as the “Holding Company”) and its subsidiaries (Holding Company and its subsidiaries referred to as “the Group”), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2025, and the consolidated statement of profit and loss (including other comprehensive income), consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including material accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the consolidated financial statements”).

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the Act, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# Revenue recognition– Fixed price contracts where revenue is recognised using percentage of completion method

See Note 5(a) and Note 12 to consolidated financial statements

# The key audit matter

The Group inter alia engages in Fixed-price contracts, wherein, revenue is recognised using the percentage of completion computed as per the input method based on the Group’s estimate of contract costs.

# How the matter was addressed in our audit

Our audit procedures included the following:

- Obtained an understanding of the systems, processes and controls implemented by the Group for recording and computing revenue and the associated contract assets, unearned and deferred revenue balances.
- Involved our Information technology (‘IT’) specialists, as required and assessed the IT environment in which the business systems operate.
- Evaluated the design and implementation and tested operating effectiveness of Group’s key manual and automated internal financial controls over.

On specific and statistically selected samples of contracts, we tested that the revenue recognised is in accordance with the revenue recognition accounting standard. This includes testing the Group’s computation of the estimation of contract costs and onerous obligations, if any, where we:

- assessed that the estimates of costs to complete were reviewed and approved by appropriate designated management personnel;
- performed a retrospective analysis of costs incurred with estimated costs to identify significant variations and challenged whether those variations are required to be considered in estimating the remaining costs to complete the contract;
- assessed the appropriateness of contract assets, unearned and deferred revenue on balance sheet date by evaluating the progress of underlying contracts, milestones achieved to identify possible changes in estimated costs to complete the remaining performance obligations;
- inspected underlying documents and performed substantive procedures over cost budget changes to determine reasonableness of contract costs.

Tested details of a sample of journal entries related to revenue recognised from percentage of completion method throughout the reporting period, using risk-based criteria, with the relevant underlying documentation.

Assessed the appropriateness of the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

# Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on the consolidated financial statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited for the year ended 31 March 2025

# Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the consolidated financial statements under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act

# Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements.

# Opinion

In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited (hereinafter referred to as “the Holding Company”) as of and for the year ended 31 March 2025, we have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of the Holding Company and such companies incorporated in India under the Companies Act, 2013, which are its subsidiary companies, as of that date.

In our opinion, the Holding Company and such companies incorporated in India which are its subsidiary companies, have, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and such internal financial controls were operating effectively as at 31 March 2025, based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by such companies considering the essential components of such internal controls stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “Guidance Note”).

# Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls

The respective company’s Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by the respective company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.

# Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements

A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

177  Consolidated Financial Statements 2024-25

that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

# Notes

# 1) Corporate information

Tata Consultancy Services Limited (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively together with employee welfare trusts referred to as “the Group”) provide IT services, consulting and business solutions and have been partnering with many of the world’s largest businesses in their transformation journeys. The Group offers a consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions. This is delivered through its unique Location-Independent Agile delivery model recognised as a benchmark of excellence in software development.

The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in India. The address of its corporate office is TCS House, Raveline Street, Fort, Mumbai- 400001. As at March 31, 2025, Tata Sons Private Limited, the holding company owned 71.74% of the Company’s equity share capital.

The Board of Directors approved the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 and authorised for issue on April 10, 2025.

# 2) Statement of compliance

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (referred to as “Ind AS”) prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to time.

# 3) Basis of preparation

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured at fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. All assets and liabilities have been classified as current and non-current as per the Group’s normal operating cycle. Based on the nature of services rendered to customers and time elapsed between deployment of resources and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the consideration for such services rendered, the Group has considered an operating cycle of 12 months.

The statement of cash flows has been prepared under indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated. The Group considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value to be cash equivalents.

# 4) Basis of consolidation

The Company consolidates all entities which are controlled by it. The Company establishes control when; it has power over the entity, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect the entity’s returns by using its power over relevant activities of the entity. Entities controlled by the Company are consolidated from the date control commences until the date control ceases. The results of subsidiaries acquired, or sold, during the year are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.

The financial statements of the Group companies are consolidated on a line-by-line basis and all inter-company transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation. Changes in the Company’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amount of the Company’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to shareholders of the Company.

Assets and liabilities of entities with functional currency other than the functional currency of the Company have been translated using exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Statement of profit and loss of such entities has been translated using weighted average exchange rates. Translation adjustments have been reported as foreign currency translation reserve in the statement of changes in equity. When a foreign operation is disposed off in its entirety or partially such that control, significant...

influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount of exchange differences related to that foreign operation recognised in OCI is reclassified to statement of profit and loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.

their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a

# 5) Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with the recognition and measurement principles of Ind AS requires management of the Group to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent liabilities as at the date of consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the periods presented.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected.

# (e) reported fair value of financial instruments.

The Group uses the following critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions in preparation of its consolidated financial statements:

# (a) Revenue recognition

Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using percentage-of-completion method. The Group estimates the future cost-to-completion of the contracts which is used to determine degree of completion of the performance obligation. The Group exercises judgement for identification of performance obligations, determination of transaction price, ascribing the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation and in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period of time. These judgements have been explained in detail under the revenue recognition note (Refer note 12).

# (b) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment

The Group reviews the useful life of property, plant and equipment at the end of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation expense in future periods (Refer note 10(a)).

# (c) Impairment of goodwill

The Group estimates the value-in-use of the cash generating units (CGUs) based on the future cash flows after considering current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results and growth rate and anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions. The estimated cash flows are developed using internal forecasts. The discount rates used for the CGUs represent the weighted average cost of capital based on the historical market returns of comparable companies (Refer note 10(b)).

# (d) Fair value measurement of financial instruments

When the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

# (f) Deferred tax assets

A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised. Accordingly, the Group exercises its judgement to reassess the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period.

# (g) Provisions and contingent liabilities

The Group estimates the provisions that have present obligations as a result of past events and it is probable that outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. The Group uses significant judgements to assess contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.

# (h) Employee benefits

The accounting of employee benefit plans in the nature of defined benefit requires the Group to use assumptions. These assumptions have been explained under employee benefits note (Refer note 14).

# (i) Leases

The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. Identification of a lease requires significant judgement. The Group uses significant judgement in assessing the

Consolidated Financial Statements 2024-25

# Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements

Lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate.

The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with both periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Group is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. In assessing whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a lease, it considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Group to exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease. The Group revises the lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period of a lease.

The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.

# 6) Recent pronouncements

Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standards or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. For the year ended March 31, 2025, MCA has notified Ind AS – 117 Insurance Contracts and amendments to Ind AS 116 – Leases, relating to sale and leaseback transactions, applicable to the Group w.e.f. April 1, 2024. The Group has reviewed the new pronouncements and based on its evaluation has determined that it does not have any significant impact in its financial statements.

# 7) Business combinations

The Group accounts for its business combinations under acquisition method of accounting. Acquisition related costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the condition for recognition are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.

Purchase consideration paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Where the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities exceed the cost of acquisition, after reassessing the fair values of the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is recognised as capital reserve.

# Financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured on initial recognition of financial asset or financial liability.

The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired.

# Cash and cash equivalents

The Group considers all highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances with banks and which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.

# Financial assets at amortised cost

Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

# Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income

Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and selling financial assets. The Group has made an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of equity investments not held for trading in other comprehensive income.

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

187  Consolidated Financial Statements 2024-25

# Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements

# Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are immediately recognised in statement of profit and loss.

The effective portion of change in the fair value of the designated hedging instrument is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading cash flow hedging reserve. The Group separates the intrinsic value and time value of an option and designates as hedging instruments only the change in intrinsic value of the option. The change in fair value of the intrinsic value and time value of an option is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accounted as a separate component of equity. Such amounts are reclassified into the statement of profit and loss when the related hedged items affect profit and loss.

# Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

# Equity instruments

An equity instrument is a contract that evidences residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received net of direct issue cost.

# Derivative accounting

# Instruments in hedging relationship

The Group designates certain foreign exchange forward, currency options and futures contracts as hedge instruments in respect of foreign exchange risks. These hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

The Group uses hedging instruments that are governed by the financial risk management policy as approved by the Risk Management Committee. The policy provides principles on the use of such financial derivatives consistent with the risk management strategy of the Company and its subsidiaries. While determining the appropriate hedge ratio, the Group takes into consideration the prevailing macro-economic conditions, the availability and liquidity of the hedging instruments, tolerance levels for hedge ineffectiveness and the costs of hedging. The hedging activities are reviewed by the Risk Management Committee every quarter and future course of action is determined.

The hedge instruments are designated and documented as hedges at the inception of the contract. The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows. The effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce the risk associated with the exposure being hedged is assessed and measured at inception and on an ongoing basis. If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in other equity are immediately reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in the statement of profit and loss.

# Instruments not in hedging relationship

The Group enters into contracts that are effective as hedges from an economic perspective, but they do not qualify for hedge accounting. The change in the fair value of such instrument is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

# Impairment of financial assets (other than at fair value)

The Group assesses at each date of balance sheet whether a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. Ind AS 109 requires expected credit losses to be measured through a loss allowance. The Group recognises lifetime expected losses for all contract assets and/or all trade receivables that do not constitute a financing transaction. In determining the allowance for expected credit losses, the Group has used a practical expedient by computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward looking information. The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and allowance rates used in the provision matrix. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-months expected credit losses or at an amount equal to the life time expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition.

Loans include inter-corporate deposits of `170 crore, with original maturity period within 24 months.

Carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans and trade payables as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, approximate the fair value due to their nature. Carrying amounts of bank deposits, earmarked balances with banks, other financial assets and other financial liabilities which are subsequently measured at amortised cost also approximate the fair value due to their nature in each of the periods presented. Fair value measurement of lease liabilities is not required. Fair value of investments carried at amortised cost is `279 crore and `1,215 crore as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

# (j) Fair value hierarchy

The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable and consists of the following three levels:

- Level 1 — Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 — Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3 — Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.

The cost of unquoted investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy approximate their fair value because there is a wide range of possible fair value measurements and the cost represents estimate of fair value within that range.

(k)     Derivative financial instruments and hedging activity
        The Group’s revenue is denominated in various foreign currencies. Given the nature of the business, a large portion of the costs are
        denominated in Indian Rupee. This exposes the Group to currency fluctuations.

        The Board of Directors has constituted a Risk Management Committee (RMC) to frame, implement and monitor the risk
        management plan of the Group which inter-alia covers risks arising out of exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Under the
        guidance and framework provided by the RMC, the Group uses various derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward,
        currency options and futures contracts in which the counter party is generally a bank.

        The following are outstanding currency options contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges:

The Group has entered into derivative instruments not in hedging relationship by way of foreign exchange forward, currency options and futures contracts. As at March 31, 2025 and 2024, the notional amount of outstanding contracts aggregated to `65,004 crore and `50,982 crore, respectively, and the respective fair value of these contracts have a net gain of `248 crore and net loss of `19 crore.

Exchange Loss of `488 crore and Gain of `109 crore on foreign exchange forward, currency options and futures contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting have been recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Net foreign exchange gain / (loss) include loss of `41 crore and `102 crore transferred from cash flow hedging reserve to the consolidated statement of profit and loss on occurrence of forecasted hedge transactions for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Net loss on derivative instruments of `15 crore recognised in cash flow hedging reserve as at March 31, 2025, is expected to be transferred to the statement of profit and loss by March 31, 2026. The maximum period over which the exposure to cash flow variability has been hedged is through calendar year 2025.

Following table summarises approximate gain / (loss) on Group’s other comprehensive income on account of appreciation / depreciation of the underlying foreign currencies:

# (l) Financial risk management

The Group is exposed primarily to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, which may adversely impact the fair value of its financial instruments. The Group has a risk management policy which covers risks associated with the financial assets and liabilities. The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors. The focus of the risk management committee is to assess the unpredictability of the financial environment and to mitigate potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group.

# Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit, liquidity and other market changes. The Group’s exposure to market risk is primarily on account of foreign currency exchange rate risk.

# Foreign currency exchange rate risk

The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets / liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective entities. Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Group operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries.

The Group, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange. Further, any movement in the functional currencies of the various operations of the Group against major foreign currencies may impact the Group’s revenue in international business.

The Group evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks. It hedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management policies.

The foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure and a simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the respective functional currencies of Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries.

The following analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures for each of the subsidiaries and Tata Consultancy Services Limited as of the date of balance sheet which could affect the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income and equity. Further the exposure as indicated below is mitigated by some of the derivative contracts entered into by the Group as disclosed in note 8(k).

# Interest rate risk

The Group’s investments are primarily in fixed rate interest bearing investments. Hence, the Group is not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.

# Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the contractual terms or obligations. Credit risk encompasses both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of customers on a continuous basis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit. Refer note 5 for methods, assumptions and information used to measure expected credit losses.

# Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements

Financial instruments that are subject to credit risk consist of trade receivables, loans, investments, derivative financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and other financial assets. Loans include inter-corporate deposits of NIL and `170 crore placed with a financial institution having a high credit-rating assigned by credit-rating agencies as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

None of the other financial instruments of the Company result in material concentration of credit risk.

# • Exposure to credit risk

The carrying amount of financial assets and contract assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk was `1,17,629 crore and `1,10,345 crore as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, being the total of the carrying amount of balances with banks, bank deposits, investments, trade receivables, loans, contract assets and other financial assets. The Group’s exposure to customers is diversified and no single customer contributes to more than 10% of outstanding trade receivables and contract assets as at March 31, 2025 and 2024.

# • Geographic concentration of credit risk

Geographic concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is as follows:

|                          |        | As at March 31, 2025 |        | As at March 31, 2024 |

Geographical concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is allocated based on the location of the customers. The allowance for lifetime expected credit losses on trade receivables for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, was `112 crore and `98 crore respectively. The reconciliation of allowance for expected credit losses is as follows:

# 9) Leases

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

# Group as a lessee

The Group accounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from non-lease components of the contract and allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative standalone price of the lease component and the aggregate standalone price of the non-lease components.

The Group recognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease commencement date. The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

The Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably similar characteristics, the Group, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable lease payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Group recognises the amount of the re-measurement of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of profit and loss depending upon the nature of modification. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Group recognises any remaining amount of the re-measurement in statement of profit and loss.

The Group has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116- Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

# Group as a lessor

At the inception of the lease the Group classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The Group recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In case of a finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net investment in the lease. When the Group is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.

Interest on lease liabilities is `631 crore and `518 crore for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

The Group incurred `343 crore and `353 crore for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, towards expenses relating to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.

The total cash outflow for leases is `2,715 crore and `2,515 crore for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, including cash outflow for short term leases and leases of low-value assets.

The Group has lease term extension options that are not reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities. The present value of future cash outflows for such extension periods is `943 crore and `815 crore as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Lease contracts entered by the Group majorly pertain for buildings taken on lease to conduct its business in the ordinary course.

The Group does not have any lease restrictions and commitment towards variable rent as per the contract.

# 10) Non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities

# (a) Property, plant and equipment

The Group recognizes the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment as an asset if, and only if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost comprising of purchase price and any initial directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use, less accumulated depreciation (other than freehold land) and impairment loss, if any.

Depreciation is provided for property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis so as to expense the cost less residual value over their estimated useful lives as prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except in respect of certain categories of assets, where the useful life of the assets has been assessed based on a technical evaluation. The estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any change in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.

The estimated useful lives are as mentioned below:

| Type of asset            | Useful lives |
| ------------------------ | ------------ |
| Buildings                | 20 years\*   |
| Leasehold improvements   | Lease term   |
| Plant and equipment      | 10 years\*   |
| Computer equipment       | 4 years\*    |
| Vehicles                 | 4 years\*    |
| Office equipment         | 2-5 years\*  |
| Electrical installations | 4-10 years\* |
| Furniture and fixtures   | 5 years\*    |

* The Group believes that the technically evaluated useful lives, different from Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, best represent the period over which these assets are expected to be used.

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

  Depreciation is not recorded on capital work-in-progress until construction and installation are complete and the asset is ready for its intended use.

# (b) Goodwill

Goodwill represents the cost of acquired business as established at the date of acquisition of the business in excess of the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount.

CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is indication for impairment. The financial projections basis which the future cash flows have been estimated consider economic uncertainties, reassessment of the discount rates, revisiting the growth rates factored while arriving at terminal value and subjecting these variables to sensitivity analysis. If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.

# Goodwill consists of the following:

|                                      | As at March 31, 2025 | As at March 31, 2024 |

| Balance at the beginning of the year | 1,832                | 1,858                |
| Translation exchange difference      | 28                   | (26)                 |
| Balance at the end of the year       | 1,860                | 1,832                |

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

# Consolidated Financial Statements 2024-25

# Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements

Goodwill of `706 crore and `689 crore as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, has been allocated to the TCS business in France. The estimated value-in-use of this CGU, as at March 31, 2025 is based on the future cash flows using a 1.50% annual growth rate for periods subsequent to the forecast period of 5 years and discount rate of 9.27%. An analysis of the sensitivity of the computation to a change in key parameters (operating margin, discount rates and long term average growth rate), based on reasonable assumptions, did not identify any probable scenario in which the recoverable amount of the CGU would decrease below its carrying amount.

The remaining amount of goodwill of `1,154 crore and `1,143 crore as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, (relating to different CGUs individually immaterial) has been evaluated based on the cash flow forecasts of the related CGUs and the recoverable amounts of these CGUs exceeded their carrying amounts. The estimated value-in-use of these CGUs, as at March 31, 2025 is based on the future cash flows using a range of 0.50%- 10.50% annual growth rate for periods subsequent to the forecast period of 5 years and discount rate in a range of 5.00% to 23.57%.

# (c) Other intangible assets

Intangible assets purchased including acquired in business combination, are measured at cost as at the date of acquisition, as applicable, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment, if any.

Intangible assets consist of rights under licensing agreement and software licences and customer-related intangibles.

| Type of asset                                          | Useful lives                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Rights under licensing agreement and software licences | Lower of licence period and 1-5 years |
| Customer-related intangibles                           | 3 years                               |

Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of its economic useful life. Intangible assets with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

# 12) Revenue recognition

The Group earns revenue primarily from providing IT services, consulting and business solutions. The Group offers a consulting-led,
cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions.

Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration which the Group expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.

- Revenue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on output basis measured by units delivered, efforts expended,
number of transactions processed, etc.
- Revenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts where the Group is standing ready to provide
services is recognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight-lined over the period of performance.
- In respect of other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognised using percentage-of-completion method (‘POC method’) of
accounting with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of the performance obligation. The contract
costs used in computing the revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.
- Revenue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and manufactured systems and third party software is
recognised upfront at the point in time when the system / software is delivered to the customer. In cases where implementation
and / or customisation services rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services and software are
accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognised over time on a POC method.
- Revenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at the point in time when control is transferred to the
customer.
- The solutions offered by the Group may include supply of third-party equipment or software. In such cases, revenue for supply
of such third party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether the Group is acting as the principal or as
an agent of the customer. The Group recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration when it is acting as a principal
and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.

Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level credits,
performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue also excludes
taxes collected from customers.

The Group’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. The Group
assesses the products / services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification
of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit
independently from such deliverables.

Judgement is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each distinct
performance obligation. The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable consideration
with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives. The
transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant financing component.

Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for a distinct product or service from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Group allocates the elements of variable considerations to all the performance obligations of the contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct performance obligations.

The Group exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period of time. The Group considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered or who controls the asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of such product or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.

Contract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for capitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The assessment of this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.

Contract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified as unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms.

Unearned and deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.

The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance based payments and / or milestone based progress payments. Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.

In accordance with Ind AS 37, the Group recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.

Contracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Group reviews modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In the event transaction price is revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.

The Group disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature of services, industry verticals and geography.

# Revenue disaggregation by nature of services is as follows:

|                                         | Year ended March 31, 2025 | Year ended March 31, 2024 |

| Sale of equipment and software licences | 3,279                     | 2,758                     |
| Total                                   | 2,55,324                  | 2,40,893                  |

Revenue disaggregation by industry vertical and geography has been included in segment information (Refer note 19).

While disclosing the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognise those revenues, the Group has applied the practical expedient in Ind AS 115. Accordingly, the Group has not disclosed the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations which pertain to contracts where revenue recognised corresponds to the value transferred to customer typically involving time and material, outcome based and event based contracts.

Unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations are subject to variability due to several factors such as terminations, changes in scope of contracts, periodic revalidations of the estimates, economic factors (changes in currency rates, tax laws etc). The aggregate value of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations is `1,84,432 crore out of which 46.03% is expected to be recognised as revenue in the next year and the balance thereafter. No consideration from contracts with customers is excluded from the amount mentioned above.

# 14) Employee benefits

# Defined benefit plans

For defined benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Past service cost, both vested and unvested, is recognised as an expense at the earlier of (a) when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs; and (b) when the entity recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits.

The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.

The Group provides benefits such as gratuity, pension and provident fund (Company managed fund) to its employees which are treated as defined benefit plans.

# Defined contribution plans

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to such benefits.

The Group provides benefits such as superannuation, provident fund (other than Company managed fund) and foreign defined contribution plans to its employees which are treated as defined contribution plans.

# Short-term employee benefits

All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short-term employee benefits. Benefits such as salaries, wages etc. and the expected cost of ex-gratia are recognised in the period in which the employee renders the related service. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid when there is a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

# Compensated absences

Compensated absences which are expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related services are recognised as undiscounted liability at the balance sheet date. Compensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related services are recognised as an actuarially determined liability at the present value of the defined benefit obligations at the balance sheet date using the Projected Unit Credit Method.

# Employee benefit expenses consist of the following:

# Employee benefit plans consist of the following:

# Gratuity and pension

In accordance with Indian law, Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries in India operate a scheme of gratuity which is a defined benefit plan. The gratuity plan provides for a lump sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death while in employment or on termination of employment of an amount equivalent to 15 to 30 days’ salary payable for each completed year of service. Vesting occurs upon completion of five continuous years of service. The Company manages the plan through a trust. Trustees administer contributions made to the trust. Certain overseas subsidiaries and branches of the Company also provide for retirement benefit pension plans in accordance with the local laws.

# The following table sets out the details of the defined benefit retirement plans and the amounts recognised in the financial statements:

The assumptions used in accounting for the defined benefit plan are set out below:

| Rate of return on plan assets                                | 6.50%- 6.75%         | 1.10%- 9.40%  | 7.00%- 7.25%         | 1.57%- 9.40%  |
| Weighted average duration of defined benefit obligations     | 6-12 Years           | 3-27 Years    | 2-11 Years           | 3-27 Years    |

Future mortality assumptions are taken based on the published statistics by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India.

The expected benefits are based on the same assumptions as are used to measure Group’s defined benefit plan obligations as at March 31, 2025. The Group is expected to contribute `40 crore to defined benefit plan obligations funds for the year ending March 31, 2026 comprising domestic component of `7 crore and foreign component of `33 crore.

The significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligations are discount rate and expected salary increase. The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.

If the discount rate increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows:

|                   |   |   | As at          | As at |                |
| ----------------- | - | - | -------------- | ----- | -------------- |
|                   |   |   | March 31, 2025 |       | March 31, 2024 |
| Increase of 0.50% |   |   |                | (318) | (272)          |
| Decrease of 0.50% |   |   |                | 350   | 300            |

If the expected salary growth increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows:

|                   | As at |                | As at |                |   |   |
| ----------------- | ----- | -------------- | ----- | -------------- | - | - |
|                   |       | March 31, 2025 |       | March 31, 2024 |   |   |
| Increase of 0.50% |       |                | 198   | 163            |   |   |
| Decrease of 0.50% |       |                | (190) | (157)          |   |   |

The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligations as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.

Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligations has been calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet.

Each year an Asset-Liability matching study is performed in which the consequences of the strategic investment policies are analysed in terms of risk and return profiles. Investment and contribution policies are integrated within this study.

The defined benefit obligations shall mature after year ended March 31, 2025 as follows:

# Provident fund

In accordance with Indian law, all eligible employees of Tata Consultancy Services Limited in India are entitled to receive benefits under the provident fund plan in which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to a trust set up by the Company to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees. This plan is a defined benefit plan as the Company is obligated to provide its members a rate of return which should, at the minimum, meet the interest rate declared by Government administered provident fund. A part of the Company’s contribution is transferred to the Government administered pension fund. The contributions made by the Company and the shortfall of interest, if any, are recognised as an expense in profit and loss under employee benefit expenses. In accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund liabilities on the basis of guidance issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions as mentioned below, there is no deficiency in the interest cost as the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than the expected amount to be credited to the individual members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of Government administered provident fund.

All eligible employees of Indian subsidiaries of the Company are entitled to receive benefits under the provident fund plan in which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to the Government administered provident fund plan. A part of the Company’s contribution is transferred to the Government administered pension fund. This plan is a defined contribution plan as the obligation of the employer is limited to the monthly contributions made to the fund. The contributions made to the fund are recognised as an expense in profit and loss under employee benefit expenses.

# 17) Income taxes

Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the year. Current and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

# Current income taxes

The current income tax expense includes income taxes payable by the Company and its subsidiaries in India and overseas.

The Company has recognised income tax expenses applying the provisions under section 115BAA of the Income-tax Act, 1961.

Current income tax payable by overseas branches of the Company is computed in accordance with the tax laws applicable in the jurisdiction in which the respective branch operates. The taxes paid are generally available for set off against the Indian income tax liability of the Company’s worldwide income.

The current income tax expense for overseas subsidiaries has been computed based on the tax laws applicable to each subsidiary in the respective jurisdiction in which it operates.

Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.

Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax paid and income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying unit intends to settle the asset and liability on a net basis.

# Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has published the model rules for global minimum tax (Pillar Two model rules). Pillar Two legislation has been enacted, or substantively enacted, in certain jurisdictions where the Group operates. The Group is within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules and has evaluated the potential exposure to global minimum tax. The Group does not expect any material financial impact for the current period. The evaluation of the potential exposure is based on the most recent country-by-country reporting, and financial statements for the constituent entities in the Group.

# Deferred income taxes

Deferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount, except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.

Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be received or settled.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the relevant entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Deferred tax assets include Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, to the extent it would be available for set off against future current income tax liability. Accordingly, MAT is recognised as deferred tax asset in the balance sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future economic benefit associated with the asset will be realised.

Under the Income-tax Act, 1961, unabsorbed business losses expire 8 years after the year in which they originate. In respect of certain foreign subsidiaries, business losses can be carried forward indefinitely unless there is a substantial change in the ownership.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets relate primarily to business losses and tax credit entitlements which do not qualify for recognition as per the applicable accounting standards. These unabsorbed business losses will expire based on the year of origination as follows:

| March 31,  | Unabsorbed business losses |
| ---------- | -------------------------- |
| 2027       | 1                          |
| 2030       | -                          |
| Thereafter | 35                         |
| Total      | 36                         |

Deferred tax liability on temporary differences of `8,352 crore as at March 31, 2025, associated with investments in subsidiaries, has not been recognised, as it is the intention of Tata Consultancy Services Limited to reinvest the earnings of these subsidiaries for the foreseeable future.

# Direct tax contingencies

The Company and its subsidiaries have ongoing disputes with income tax authorities in India and in some of the other jurisdictions where they operate. The disputes relate to tax treatment of certain expenses claimed as deduction, computation or eligibility of tax incentives and allowances and characterisation of fees for services received. Contingent liability in respect of tax demands received from direct tax authorities in India and other jurisdictions is `1,073 crore and `1,871 crore as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively. These demand orders are being contested by the Company and its subsidiaries based on the management evaluation and advise of tax consultants. In respect of tax contingencies of `318 crore and `318 crore as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, not included above, the Company is entitled to an indemnification from the seller of TCS e-Serve Limited.

The Group periodically receives notices and inquiries from income tax authorities related to the Group’s operations in the jurisdictions it operates in. The Group has evaluated these notices and inquiries and has concluded that any consequent income tax claims or demands by the income tax authorities will not succeed on ultimate resolution.

The number of years that are subject to tax assessments varies depending on tax jurisdiction. The major tax jurisdictions of Tata Consultancy Services Limited include India, United States of America and United Kingdom. In India, tax filings from fiscal 2022 are generally subject to examination by the tax authorities. In United States of America, the federal statute of limitation applies to fiscals 2020 and earlier and applicable state statutes of limitation vary by state. In United Kingdom, the statute of limitation generally applies to fiscal 2019 and earlier.

# 18) Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. The Company did not have any potentially dilutive securities in any of the periods presented.

| Year ended                                                                 | March 31, 2025 | March 31, 2024 |

# 19) Segment information

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. The Group’s chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director.

The Group has identified business segments (‘industry vertical’) as reportable segments. The business segments comprise: 1) Banking, Financial Services and Insurance, 2) Manufacturing, 3) Consumer Business, 4) Communication, Media and Technology, 5) Life Sciences and Healthcare and 6) Others such as Energy, Resources and Utilities, s-Governance and Products.

Revenue and expenses directly attributable to segments are reported under each reportable segment. Expenses which are not directly identifiable to each reporting segment have been allocated on the basis of associated revenue of the segment. All other expenses which are not attributable or allocable to segments have been disclosed as unallocable expenses.

The assets and liabilities of the Group are used interchangeably amongst segments. Allocation of such assets and liabilities is not practicable and any forced allocation would not result in any meaningful segregation. Hence assets and liabilities have not been identified to any of the reportable segments.

Summarised segment information for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, is as follows:

| Year ended March 31, 2025                           |        |               |        |                   |                                     |                              | (\` crore) |       |   |   |   |   |   |

# Contingencies

- Direct tax matters
Refer note 17.
- Indirect tax matters
The Company and its subsidiaries have ongoing disputes with tax authorities mainly relating to treatment of characterisation and classification of certain items. The Company and its subsidiaries have demands amounting to `1,190 crore and `1,161 crore as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, from various indirect tax authorities which are being contested by the Company and its subsidiaries based on the management evaluation and advice of tax consultants.
- Other claims
Claims aggregating `248 crore and `226 crore as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, against the Group have not been acknowledged as debts.
In April 2019, Computer Sciences Corporation (referred to as CSC) filed a legal claim against the Company in the Court of Northern District of Texas and Dallas Division (trial court) alleging misappropriation of trade secrets and other CSC’s confidential information and sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, and unspecified monetary damages and disgorgement of profits.

A trial before an advisory jury was held and on November 17, 2023, the jury returned an advisory verdict in favour of CSC, finding that the Company misappropriated CSC’s trade secrets and recommended compensation of US $70 million (equivalent to `598 crore) and a further punitive damage of US $140 million (equivalent to `1,196 crore) to be paid by the Company to CSC. Subsequently, the parties filed their respective written submissions in the matter. On June 13, 2024, the trial court passed a judgement as follows:

1. The Court ordered that the Company is liable to CSC for US $56 million (equivalent to `478 crore) in compensatory damages and US $112 million (equivalent to `957 crore) in exemplary damages.
2. The Court also assessed that the Company is liable for US $26 million (equivalent to `222 crore) in prejudgment interest through June 13, 2024.
3. The Court also passed certain injunction and other reliefs against the Company.

Pursuant to US Court procedures, a Letter of Credit has been made available to CSC for `2,136 crore (US $250 million) as financial security in order to stay execution of the judgement pending appeal proceedings and conclusion. The Company, based on external opinion and legal assessment, believes that it has a strong case and would defend its position vigorously and pursue legal remedies to overturn the adverse judgement of the trial court.

In October 2014, Epic Systems Corporation (referred to as Epic) filed a legal claim against the Company in the Court of Western District Madison, Wisconsin alleging unauthorised access to and download of their confidential information and use thereof in the development of the Company’s product MedMantra. Pursuant to unfavourable judgment from the District Court and Appeals Court which awarded US $140 million as compensatory damages and US $140 million as punitive damages, Epic invoked payment of US $140 million out of US $440 million Letter of Credit provided as security, towards compensatory damages in April 2022. The Company’s petition to the Supreme Court to review the entire judgement including both the compensatory and punitive damages re-affirmed by the Appeals Court was rejected by the Supreme Court on November 20, 2023, pursuant to which, punitive damages of US $140 million was paid on December 1, 2023. The Company provided the balance punitive damages amount of US $115 million (equivalent to `958 crore) in its financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 and disclosed the same as an “exceptional item” in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

# Letter of comfort

The Company has given letter of comfort to banks for credit facilities availed by its subsidiaries. As per the terms of letter of comfort, the Company undertakes not to divest its ownership interest directly or indirectly in the subsidiary and provide such managerial, technical and financial assistance to ensure continued successful operations of the subsidiary.

The amounts assessed as contingent liability do not include interest that could be claimed by counter parties.

3. On January 29, 2025, the Share Purchase and Securities Purchase Agreement (SSPA) has been executed between Tata Consultancy Services Limited (Company), Tata Realty and Infrastructure Limited (TRIL), TRIL Bengaluru Real Estate Five Limited (TBRF) and TRIL Bengaluru Real Estate Six Limited (TBRS) for acquisition of 100% equity shares and optionally redeemable convertible debentures of TBRF and TBRS held by TRIL, in two tranches at a consideration of `1,593 crore. The acquisition of TBRF and TBRS does not meet the definition of ‘business’ in accordance with Ind AS- 103 Business Combinations and is treated as acquisition of assets. The fair value of freehold land as determined by independent valuation is `1,600 crore. The fair value of capital work-in-progress is `25 crore, inter-corporate deposits is `27 crore and the balance is towards the other assets and liabilities taken over. Based on the terms of the SSPA, on January 29, 2025 the Company paid `1,036 crore and recognised a financial liability of `557 crore (towards consideration payable at a future date for 35% stake) to acquire the entire stake in equity shares and optionally redeemable convertible debentures in TBRF and TBRS. Consequently, TBRF and TBRS have become wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company from that date.

# Independent Auditor’s Report

# Basis for Opinion

To the Members of Tata Consultancy Services Limited

# Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements

# Opinion

We have audited the standalone financial statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited (the “Company”) which comprise the standalone balance sheet as at 31 March 2025, and the standalone statement of profit and loss (including other comprehensive income), standalone statement of changes in equity and standalone statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the standalone financial statements, including material accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 March 2025, and its profit and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# Revenue recognition-Fixed price contracts where revenue is recognised using percentage of completion method

Refer Note 4(a) and 10 to standalone financial statements

# The key audit matter

The Company inter alia engages in Fixed-price contracts, wherein, revenue is recognised using the percentage of completion computed as per the input method based on the Company’s estimate of contract costs.

# How the matter was addressed in our audit

Our audit procedures included the following:

- Obtained an understanding of the systems, processes and controls implemented by the Company for recording and computing revenue and the associated contract assets, unearned and deferred revenue balances.
- Involved our Information technology (‘IT’) specialists, as required and assessed the IT environment in which the business systems operate.
- Evaluated the design and implementation and tested operating effectiveness of Company’s key manual and automated internal financial controls over:
- Computation of revenue recognition;
- Cost and revenue reports generated by the system;
- Allocation of resources and budgeting systems which prevent the unauthorised recording/changes to costs incurred; and
- Estimation of contract costs required to complete the respective projects.
- On specific and statistically selected samples of contracts, we tested that the revenue recognised is in accordance with the revenue recognition accounting standard. This includes testing the Company’s computation of the estimation of contract costs and onerous obligations, if any, where we:
- assessed that the estimates of costs to complete were reviewed and approved by appropriate designated management personnel;
- performed a retrospective analysis of costs incurred with estimated costs to identify significant variations and challenged whether those variations are required to be considered in estimating the remaining costs to complete the contract;
- assessed the appropriateness of contract assets, unearned and deferred revenue on balance sheet date by evaluating the progress of underlying contracts and milestones achieved to identify possible changes in estimated costs to complete the remaining performance obligations;
- inspected underlying documents and performed substantive procedures over cost budget changes to determine reasonableness of contract costs.
- Tested details of a sample of journal entries related to revenue recognised from percentage of completion method throughout the reporting period, using risk-based criteria, with the relevant underlying documentation.
- Assessed the appropriateness of the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements.

# Other Information

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements

The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Company’s annual report, but does not include the financial statements and auditor’s report thereon. The Company’s annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.

In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

When we read the Company’s annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take necessary actions, as applicable under the relevant laws and regulations.

# Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the Standalone Financial Statements

The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit/loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the standalone financial statements, the Management and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.

• Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of standalone financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

# Annexure B to the Independent Auditor’s Report on the standalone financial statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited for the year ended 31 March 2025

# Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the financial statements and their operating effectiveness.

Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

# Opinion

We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements of Tata Consultancy Services Limited (“the Company”) as of 31 March 2025 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.

In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and such internal financial controls were operating effectively as at 31 March 2025, based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “Guidance Note”).

# Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements

A company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

# Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls

The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.

Financial controls with reference to financial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

# Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

# Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements.

# Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements

# 1) Corporate information

Tata Consultancy Services Limited (referred to as “TCS Limited” or “the Company”) provides IT services, consulting and business solutions and has been partnering with many of the world’s largest businesses in their transformation journeys. The Company offers a consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions. This is delivered through its unique Location-Independent Agile delivery model recognised as a benchmark of excellence in software development. The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in India. The address of its corporate office is TCS House, Raveline Street, Fort, Mumbai- 400001. As at March 31, 2025, Tata Sons Private Limited, the holding company owned 71.74% of the Company’s equity share capital. The Board of Directors approved the standalone financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2025 and authorised for issue on April 10, 2025.

# 2) Statement of compliance

These standalone financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (referred to as “Ind AS”) as prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to time.

# 3) Basis of preparation

These standalone financial statements have been prepared on historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured at fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. All assets and liabilities have been classified as current and non-current as per the Company’s normal operating cycle. Based on the nature of services rendered to customers and time elapsed between deployment of resources and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the consideration for such services rendered, the Company has considered an operating cycle of 12 months. The statement of cash flows has been prepared under indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated. The Company considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value to be cash equivalents.

# (a) Revenue recognition

Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using percentage-of-completion method. The Company estimates the future cost-to-completion of the contracts which is used to determine degree of completion of the performance obligation. The Company exercises judgement for identification of performance obligations, determination of transaction price, ascribing the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation and in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period of time. These judgements have been explained in detail under the revenue recognition note (Refer note 10).

# (b) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment

The Company reviews the useful life of property, plant and equipment at the end of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in depreciation expense in future periods (Refer note 8(a)).

# (c) Impairment of investments in subsidiaries

The Company reviews its carrying value of investments carried at cost (net of impairment, if any) annually, or more frequently when there is indication for impairment.

# Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements

# (d) Fair value measurement of financial instruments

When the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

# (e) Impairment of financial assets (other than at fair value)

Measurement of impairment of financial assets require use of estimates, which have been explained in the note on financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments, under impairment of financial assets (other than at fair value) (Refer note 6).

# (f) Deferred tax assets

A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised. Accordingly, the Company exercises its judgement to reassess the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period.

# (g) Provisions and contingent liabilities

The Company estimates the provisions that have present obligations as a result of past events and it is probable that outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. The Company uses significant judgements to assess contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the standalone financial statements.

# (h) Employee benefits

The accounting of employee benefit plans in the nature of defined benefit requires the Company to use significant judgement in assessing the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate.

# 5) Recent pronouncements

Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standards or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. For the year ended March 31, 2025, MCA has notified Ind AS – 117 Insurance Contracts and amendments to Ind AS 116 – Leases, relating to sale and leaseback transactions, applicable to the Company w.e.f. April 1, 2024. The Company has reviewed the new pronouncements and based on its evaluation has determined that it does not have any significant impact in its financial statements.

# 6) Financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured on initial recognition of financial asset or financial liability.

The Company derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire.

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Standalone Financial Statements 2024-25

# Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements

or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired.

# Cash and cash equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value, to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances with banks and which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.

# Financial assets at amortised cost

Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

# Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income

Financial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if these financial assets are held within a business whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and selling financial assets.

The Company has made an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of equity investments not held for trading in other comprehensive income.

# Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are immediately recognised in statement of profit and loss.

# Investment in subsidiaries

Investment in subsidiaries are measured at cost less impairment loss, if any.

# Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

# Equity instruments

An equity instrument is a contract that evidences residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognised at the proceeds received net of direct issue cost.

# Derivative accounting

- Instruments in hedging relationship
The Company designates certain foreign exchange forward, currency options and futures contracts as hedge instruments in respect of foreign exchange risks. These hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

The Company uses hedging instruments that are governed by the financial risk management policy as approved by the Risk Management Committee. The policy provides principles on the use of such financial derivatives consistent with the risk management strategy of the Company. While determining the appropriate hedge ratio, the Company takes into consideration the prevailing macro-economic conditions, the availability and liquidity of the hedging instruments, tolerance levels for hedge ineffectiveness and the costs of hedging. The hedging activities are reviewed by the Risk Management Committee every quarter and future course of action is determined.

The hedge instruments are designated and documented as hedges at the inception of the contract. The Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows.

The effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce the risk associated with the exposure being hedged is assessed and measured at inception and on an ongoing basis. If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in other equity are immediately reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in the statement of profit and loss.

The effective portion of change in the fair value of the designated hedging instrument is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading cash flow hedging reserve.

The Company separates the intrinsic value and time value of an option and designates as hedging instruments only the change in intrinsic value of the option. The change in fair value of the intrinsic value and time value of an option is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accounted as a separate component of equity. Such amounts are reclassified into the statement of profit and loss when the related hedged items affect profit and loss.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity till that time remains and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the forecasted transaction ultimately affects profit and loss. Any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss when the hedge becomes ineffective.

259  Standalone Financial Statements 2024-25

# Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements

• Instruments not in hedging relationship

The Company enters into contracts that are effective as hedges from an economic perspective, but they do not qualify for hedge accounting. The change in the fair value of such instrument is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

# Impairment of financial assets (other than at fair value)

The Company assesses at each date of balance sheet whether a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. Ind AS 109 requires expected credit losses to be measured through a loss allowance. The Company recognises lifetime expected losses for all contract assets and/or all trade receivables that do not constitute a financing transaction. In determining the allowance for expected credit losses, the Company has used a practical expedient by computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward looking information. The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and allowance rates used in the provision matrix. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-months expected credit losses or at an amount equal to the life time expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition.

Based on the terms of the SSPA, on January 29, 2025 the Company paid `1,036 crore and recognised a financial liability of `557 crore (towards consideration payable at a future date for 35% stake) to acquire the entire stake in equity shares and optionally redeemable convertible debentures in TBRF and TBRS. Consequently, TBRF and TBRS have become wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company from that date.

# Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements

Carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans and trade payables as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, approximate the fair value due to their nature. Carrying amounts of bank deposits, earmarked balances with banks, other financial assets and other financial liabilities which are subsequently measured at amortised cost also approximate the fair value due to their nature in each of the periods presented. Fair value measurement of lease liabilities is not required. Fair value of investments carried at amortised cost is NIL and `940 crore as at March 31, 2025 and 2024 respectively.

# (k) Fair value hierarchy

The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable and consists of the following three levels:

- Level 1 – Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 – Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3 – Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.

The cost of unquoted investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy approximate their fair value because there is a wide range of possible fair value measurements and the cost represents estimate of fair value within that range.

# (l) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activity

The Company’s revenue is denominated in various foreign currencies. Given the nature of the business, a large portion of the costs are denominated in Indian Rupee. This exposes the Company to currency fluctuations.

The Board of Directors has constituted a Risk Management Committee (RMC) to frame, implement and monitor the risk management plan of the Company which inter-alia covers risks arising out of exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Under the guidance and framework provided by the RMC, the Company uses various derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward, currency options and futures contracts in which the counter party is generally a bank.

# (m) Financial risk management

The Company is exposed primarily to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, which may adversely impact the fair value of its financial instruments. The Company has a risk management policy which covers risks associated with the financial assets and liabilities. The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors. The focus of the risk management committee is to assess the unpredictability of the financial environment and to mitigate potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Company.

# Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit, liquidity and other market changes. The Company’s exposure to market risk is primarily on account of foreign currency exchange rate risk.

# • Foreign currency exchange rate risk

The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets / liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company. Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Company operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries.

The Company, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange. Further, any movement in the functional currency of the various operations of the Company against major foreign currencies may impact the Company’s revenue in international business.

The Company evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks. It hedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management policies.

The foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure and a simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the functional currency of the Company.

The following analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures of the Company as of the date of balance sheet which could affect the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income and equity. Further the exposure as indicated below is mitigated by some of the derivative contracts entered into by the Company as disclosed in note 6(l).

The following table sets forth information relating to unhedged foreign currency exposure as at March 31, 2025:

|                           | USD      | EUR   | GBP   | Others |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| Net financial assets      | 7,508    | 533   | 526   | 2,327  |
| Net financial liabilities | (10,726) | (350) | (376) | (862)  |

10% appreciation / depreciation of the functional currency of the Company with respect to various foreign currencies would result in increase / decrease in the Company’s profit before taxes by approximately `142 crore for the year ended March 31, 2025.

# Interest rate risk

The Company’s investments are primarily in fixed rate interest bearing investments. Hence, the Company is not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.

# Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the contractual terms or obligations. Credit risk encompasses both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of customers on a continuous basis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit. Refer note 4 for methods, assumptions and information used to measure expected credit losses.

Financial instruments that are subject to credit risk consist of trade receivables, loans, investments, derivative financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and other financial assets. Loans include Inter-corporate deposits of `36 crore placed with two subsidiaries as at March 31, 2025 and NIL as at March 31, 2024, respectively. Bank deposits include an amount of `3,692 crore held with two banks and `2,500 crore held with two banks, having high credit rating which are individually in excess of 10% or more of the Company’s total bank deposits as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. None of the other financial instruments of the Company result in material concentration of credit risk.

# Exposure to credit risk

The carrying amount of financial assets and contract assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk was `96,535 crore and `90,407 crore as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, being the total of the carrying amount of balances with banks, bank deposits, investments excluding equity and preference investments, trade receivables, loans, contract assets and other financial assets.

The Company’s exposure to customers is diversified. As at March 31, 2025, a single customer held more than 10% of the outstanding of trade receivables and contract assets at 10.28%. As at March 31, 2024, no single customer held more than 10% of outstanding of trade receivables and contract assets.

# Geographic concentration of credit risk

Geographic concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is as follows:

|                          | As at March 31, 2025 |       | As at March 31, 2024 |       |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ----- | -------------------- | ----- |
|                          | Gross%               | Net%  | Gross%               | Net%  |
| United States of America | 45.08                | 45.80 | 52.31                | 53.20 |
| India                    | 21.98                | 20.68 | 13.22                | 11.68 |
| United Kingdom           | 15.62                | 15.88 | 16.47                | 16.78 |

Geographic concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is allocated based on the location of the customers.

# 7) Leases

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

# Company as a lessee

The Company accounts for each lease component within the contract as a lease separately from non-lease components of the contract and allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative standalone price of the lease component and the aggregate standalone price of the non-lease components.

The Company recognises right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term at the lease commencement date. The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

The Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably similar characteristics, the Company, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable lease payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease.

The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Company recognises the amount of the re-measurement of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of profit and loss depending upon the nature of modification. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Company recognises any remaining amount of the re-measurement in statement of profit and loss.

The Company has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116- Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

# Company as a lessor

At the inception of the lease the Company classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The Company recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In case of a finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net investment in the lease. When the Company is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Company applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.

If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Company applies Ind AS 115- Revenue from contracts with customers to allocate the consideration in the contract.

# 8) Non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities

# (a) Property, plant and equipment

The Company recognises the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment as an asset if, and only if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost comprising of purchase price and any initial directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use, less accumulated depreciation (other than freehold land) and impairment loss, if any.

Depreciation is provided for property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis so as to expense the cost less residual value over their estimated useful lives as prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except in respect of certain categories of assets, where the useful life of the assets has been assessed based on a technical evaluation. The estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any change in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.

The estimated useful lives are as mentioned below:

| Type of asset            | Useful lives |
| ------------------------ | ------------ |
| Buildings                | 20 years\*   |
| Leasehold improvements   | Lease term   |
| Plant and equipment      | 10 years\*   |
| Computer equipment       | 4 years\*    |
| Vehicles                 | 4 years\*    |
| Office equipment         | 2-5 years\*  |
| Electrical installations | 4-10 years\* |
| Furniture and fixtures   | 5 years\*    |

*The Company believes that the technically evaluated useful lives, different from Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, best represent the period over which these assets are expected to be used.

Depreciation is not recorded on capital work-in-progress until construction and installation are complete and the asset is ready for its intended use.

Property, plant and equipment with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

The carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment shall be derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.

# (b) Intangible assets

Intangible assets purchased are measured at cost as at the date of acquisition, as applicable, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment, if any.

Intangible assets consist of rights under licensing agreement and software licences which are amortised over licence period which equates the economic useful life ranging between 1-5 years on a straight-line basis over the period of its economic useful life.

Intangible assets with finite life are evaluated for recoverability whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount (i.e. higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

# 10) Revenue recognition

The Company earns revenue primarily from providing IT services, consulting and business solutions. The Company offers a consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions.

Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services.

- Revenue from time and material and job contracts is recognised on output basis measured by units delivered, efforts expended, number of transactions processed, etc.

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

Standalone Financial Statements 2024-25

# Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements

- Revenue related to fixed price maintenance and support services contracts where the Company is standing ready to provide services is recognised based on time elapsed mode and revenue is straight-lined over the period of performance.
- In respect of other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognised using percentage-of-completion method (‘POC method’) of accounting with contract costs incurred determining the degree of completion of the performance obligation. The contract costs used in computing the revenues include cost of fulfilling warranty obligations.
- Revenue from the sale of distinct internally developed software and manufactured systems and third party software is recognised upfront at the point in time when the system / software is delivered to the customer. In cases where implementation and / or customisation services rendered significantly modifies or customises the software, these services and software are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognised over time on a POC method.
- Revenue from the sale of distinct third party hardware is recognised at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer.
- The solutions offered by the Company may include supply of third-party equipment or software. In such cases, revenue for supply of such third party products are recorded at gross or net basis depending on whether the Company is acting as the principal or as an agent of the customer. The Company recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration when it is acting as a principal and at net amount of consideration when it is acting as an agent.

Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is the consideration, adjusted for volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives, if any, as specified in the contract with the customer. Revenue also excludes taxes collected from customers.

The Company’s contracts with customers could include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. The Company assesses the products / services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables.

Judgement is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation. The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable consideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant financing component. Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for a distinct product or service from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Company allocates the elements of variable considerations to all the performance obligations of the contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct performance obligations.

The Company exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period of time. The Company considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered or who controls the asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of such product or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.

Revenue from subsidiaries is recognised based on transaction price which is at arm’s length.

Contract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for capitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The assessment of this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.

Contract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified as unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms.

Unearned and deferred revenue (“contract liability”) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.

The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance based payments and / or milestone based progress payments. Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.

# Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements

In accordance with Ind AS 37, the Company recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.

Contracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Company reviews modification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In the event transaction price is revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.

The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature of services, industry verticals and geography.

# Revenue disaggregation by nature of services is as follows:

Geographical revenue is allocated based on the location of the customers.

- (1) includes revenue in the United States of America of `1,11,607 crore and `1,11,862 crore for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
- (2) includes revenue in the United Kingdom of `38,104 crore and `35,625 crore for the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Information about major customers: No single customer represents 10% or more of the Company’s total revenue during the years ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.

While disclosing the aggregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognise those revenues, the Company has applied the practical expedient in Ind AS 115. Accordingly, the Company has not disclosed the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations which pertain to contracts where revenue recognised corresponds to the value transferred to customer typically involving time and material, outcome based and event based contracts.

# Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements

Unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations are subject to variability due to several factors such as terminations, changes in scope of contracts, periodic revalidations of the estimates, economic factors (changes in currency rates, tax laws etc). The aggregate value of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations is `1,55,554 crore out of which 46.47% is expected to be recognised as revenue in the next year and the balance thereafter. No consideration from contracts with customers is excluded from the amount mentioned above.

# 12) Employee benefits

Defined benefit plans For defined benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Past service cost, both vested and unvested, is recognised as an expense at the earlier of (a) when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs; and (b) when the entity recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits.

The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.

The Company provides benefits such as gratuity, pension and provident fund (Company managed fund) to its employees which are treated as defined benefit plans.

Defined contribution plans Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to such benefits.

The Company provides benefits such as superannuation and foreign defined contribution plans to its employees which are treated as defined contribution plans.

# Notes forming part of Standalone Financial Statements

# Short-term employee benefits

All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short-term employee benefits. Benefits such as salaries, wages etc. and the expected cost of ex-gratia are recognised in the period in which the employee renders the related service. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid when there is a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

# Compensated absences

Compensated absences which are expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related services are recognised as undiscounted liability at the balance sheet date. Compensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employee renders the related services are recognised as an actuarially determined liability at the present value of the defined benefit obligations at the balance sheet date using the Projected Unit Credit Method.

# Employee benefit expenses consist of the following:

Future mortality assumptions are taken based on the published statistics by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India.

The expected benefits are based on the same assumptions as are used to measure the Company’s defined benefit plan obligations as at March 31, 2025. The Company does not expect to contribute to defined benefit plan obligations funds for year ending March 31, 2026 in view of adequate surplus plan assets as at March 31, 2025.

The significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the defined benefit obligations are discount rate and expected salary increase. The sensitivity analysis below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.

# If the discount rate increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows:

| (\` crore)        | As at March 31, 2025 | As at March 31, 2024 |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Increase of 0.50% | (155)                | (123)                |
| Decrease of 0.50% | 163                  | 129                  |

# If the expected salary growth increases / decreases by 0.50%, the defined benefit obligations would increase / (decrease) as follows:

| (\` crore)        | As at March 31, 2025 | As at March 31, 2024 |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Increase of 0.50% | 163                  | 130                  |
| Decrease of 0.50% | (156)                | (125)                |

The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligations as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.

Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligations has been calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet. Each year an Asset- Liability matching study is performed in which the consequences of the strategic investment policies are analysed in terms of risk and return profiles. Investment and contribution policies are integrated within this study.

The defined benefit obligations shall mature after the year ended March 31, 2025 as follows:

| Year ending March 31, | Defined benefit obligations |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 2026                  | 823                         |

# Provident fund

In accordance with Indian law, all eligible employees of the Company in India are entitled to receive benefits under the provident fund plan in which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to a trust set up by the Company to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees. This plan is a defined benefit plan as the Company is obligated to provide its members a rate of return which should, at the minimum, meet the interest rate declared by Government administered provident fund. A part of the Company’s contribution is transferred to the Government administered pension fund. The contributions made by the Company and the shortfall of interest, if any, are recognised as an expense in statement of profit and loss under employee benefit expenses. In accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund liabilities on the basis of guidance issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions as mentioned below, there is no deficiency in the interest cost as the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than the expected amount to be credited to the individual members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of Government administered provident fund.

The following table sets out the details of the defined benefit provident fund plan and the amounts recognised in the financial statements:

# 15) Income taxes

Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the year. Current and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

# Current income taxes

The current income tax expense includes income taxes payable by the Company in India and in its branches in overseas where it operates. The Company has recognised income tax expenses applying the provisions under section 115BAA of the Income-tax Act, 1961. Current income tax payable by overseas branches of the Company is computed in accordance with the tax laws applicable in the jurisdiction in which the respective branch operates. The taxes paid are generally available for set off against the Indian income tax liability of the Company’s worldwide income.

Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. Advance taxes and provisions for current income taxes are presented in the balance sheet after off-setting advance tax paid and income tax provision arising in the same tax jurisdiction and where the relevant tax paying unit intends to settle the asset and liability on a net basis.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has published the model rules for global minimum tax (Pillar Two model rules). Pillar Two legislation has been enacted, or substantively enacted, in certain jurisdictions where the Company operates. The Company is within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules and has evaluated the potential exposure to global minimum tax. The Company does not expect any material financial impact for the current period. The evaluation of the potential exposure is based on the most recent country-by-country reporting, and financial statements for the constituent entities in the Company.

# Deferred income taxes

Deferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount, except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be received or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the relevant entity intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Claims aggregating `120 crore and `126 crore as at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, against the Company have not

In April 2019, Computer Sciences Corporation (referred to as CSC) filed a legal claim against the Company in the Court
of Northern District of Texas and Dallas Division (trial court) alleging misappropriation of trade secrets and other CSC’s
confidential information and sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, and unspecified monetary damages and
disgorgement of profits.

A trial before an advisory jury was held and on November 17, 2023, the jury returned an advisory verdict in favour of
CSC, finding that the Company misappropriated CSC’s trade secrets and recommended compensation of US $70 million
(equivalent to `598 crore) and a further punitive damage of US $140 million (equivalent to `1,196 crore) to be paid by the
Company to CSC. Subsequently, the parties filed their respective written submissions in the matter. On June 13, 2024, the
trial court passed a judgement as follows:

1. The Court ordered that the Company is liable to CSC for US $56 million (equivalent to `478 crore) in compensatory
damages and US $112 million (equivalent to `957 crore) in exemplary damages.
2. The Court also assessed that the Company is liable for US $26 million (equivalent to `222 crore) in prejudgment
interest through June 13, 2024.
3. The Court also passed certain injunction and other reliefs against the Company.

Pursuant to US Court procedures, a Letter of Credit has been made available to CSC for `2,136 crore (US $250 million) as
financial security in order to stay execution of the judgement pending appeal proceedings and conclusion.

In October 2014, Epic Systems Corporation (referred to as Epic) filed a legal claim against the Company in the Court of
Western District Madison, Wisconsin alleging unauthorised access to and download of their confidential information
and use thereof in the development of the Company’s product MedMantra. Pursuant to unfavourable judgment from
the District Court and Appeals Court which awarded US $140 million as compensatory damages and US $140 million
as punitive damages, Epic invoked payment of US $140 million out of US $440 million Letter of Credit provided as
security, towards compensatory damages in April 2022. The Company’s petition to the Supreme Court to review the
entire judgement including both the compensatory and punitive damages re-affirmed by the Appeals Court was rejected
by the Supreme Court on November 20, 2023, pursuant to which, punitive damages of US $140 million was paid on
December 1, 2023. The Company provided the balance punitive damages amount of US $115 million (equivalent to
`958 crore) in its financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 and disclosed the same as an “exceptional item”

# Explanation of Terms

5G Fifth generation wireless technology for digital cellular networks. 5G is expected to be much faster and enable much higher volumes of data sharing than earlier generations of cellular networks. Its massive capacity and ultra-low latency are expected to usher in an era of hyper-connectivity, enabling newer use cases such as autonomous cars, and accelerating the adoption of IoT.

Adaptive AI Adaptive AI systems support a decision-making framework centered around making faster decisions while remaining flexible to adjust as issues arise. These systems aim to continuously learn based on new data at runtime to adapt more quickly to changes in real-world circumstances. The AI engineering framework can help orchestrate and optimize applications to adapt to, resist or absorb disruptions, facilitating the management of adaptive systems.

Agentic AI Agentic AI uses sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning to autonomously solve complex, multi-step problems.

Agile A collaborative approach for IT and business teams to develop software incrementally and faster. TCS has pioneered the Location Independent Agile™ model that allows for deployment at scale and helps globally distributed organization execute large transformational programs quickly, while ensuring stability and quality.

Agile Workspaces These are key enablers of TCS’ Location Independent Agile model and represent the next generation work environment that facilitates greater collaboration among teams. It is characterized by partition-less open offices, informal seating, interactive surfaces for information capture, and modern collaboration devices for increased productivity.

AgilityDebt™ AgilityDebt™ is a simple index developed by TCS, which uniquely indicates the burden carried by an organization that restricts its Agility. The index is arrived at based on a holistic Agile maturity assessment framework that measures the gap against required Agile talent, roles, team composition, delivery practices, Agile culture, Agile technology and DevOps enablers. TCS uses AgilityDebt™ to assess where the customer’s teams are in the Agile journey, find the bottlenecks, and accelerate their Agile transformations.

AI Assistant A software agent that uses AI technologies to perform tasks or services for an individual. These assistants can understand and interpret human speech or text inputs, enabling them to execute commands, answer questions, or assist with tasks like scheduling, reminding, or even controlling smart home devices.

AI Copilot A virtual assistant that offers real-time guidance and feedback to enhance a human being’s work.

AI Engineering AI engineering is foundational for enterprise delivery of AI solutions at scale. The discipline unifies DataOps, MLOps and DevOps pipelines to create coherent enterprise development, delivery (hybrid, multicloud, edge), and operational (streaming, batch) AI-based systems.

AIOps AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) combines big data and machine learning to automate IT operations processes, including event correlation, anomaly detection and causality determination.

# Glossary

# Fixed Price Contracts

A form of services contracts where the vendor takes a turnkey responsibility for delivering a solution for a certain price and within a mutually agreed timeframe. The customer is billed on completion of key project milestones and related deliverables. This arrangement gives the vendor considerable flexibility in the staffing and execution of the project. On the other hand, it also means bearing the project risk.

# Foundation Models

Foundation models are large-parameter models that are trained on a broad gamut of datasets in a self-supervised manner. They are mostly based on transformers or diffusion deep neural network architectures and will potentially be multimodal in the near future. They are called foundation models because of their critical importance and applicability to a wide variety of downstream use cases. This broad applicability is due to the pretraining and versatility of the models.

# Framework

A kind of intellectual property, consisting of software which provides generic functionality for a certain business use case, and which is customized for a specific customer’s needs with additional code. Use of such pre-built code reduces time to market and results in more stable, reliable solutions.

# Free Cash Flow

Represents the cash a company generates through its operations, less the capital expenditure.

Free cash flow = Cash flow from operating activities – Capital expenditure

# Function Point

A function point is a granular building block of software, based on a functional view of that system, represented by a code snippet whose logic helps the user accomplish something. The concept is used while estimating the effort for building a new application, by decomposing it into its constituent function points of varying levels of complexity.

# Furlough

A temporary cessation of work without pay for the employees, usually implemented by organizations facing difficult economic conditions, and in lieu of laying off employees.

# Gamification

The process of adding games or game-like elements to any activity to enrich experiences and encourage user participation.

# GDPR

General Data Protection Regulation, a European Union regulation for data protection and privacy.

# Generative AI

Generative AI describes any type of artificial intelligence (AI) that is capable of generating new content, including text, images, video, audio, simulations, code or synthetic data. It involves the use of machine learning algorithms to learn patterns across a large data set and generate new content based on those patterns.

# Global Capability Centers (GCC) / Captive units

Captive units include both MNC-owned units that undertake work for the parents’ global operations and the company owned units of domestic firms, set up in offshore locations offering cheaper labor pool, helping the parent to reduce its operational costs.

# Green-Tariff

Green tariffs are specialized retail tariffs that electricity distribution companies (discoms) charge for the sale of Renewable Energy (RE) to their consumers. Businesses can sign up for these tariffs and claim RE consumption, while discoms procure electricity on their behalf from RE project developers.

# Greenhouse Gas

These are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere leading to global warming and climate change.

# Growth and Transformation

Initiatives launched to improve the enterprise’s revenues, leveraging technology to adopt new business models, drive new revenue streams, enhance customer experience or target new customer segments. This contrasts with traditional outsourcing engagements where the focus is on improving efficiency and saving costs.

# Hallucination

Tendency of large language models to make things up or provide output that seems plausible but is factually incorrect or unverifiable.

# Hybrid Cloud

An enterprise IT infrastructure model that combines private clouds, public clouds and on-premise data centers, to meet the compute and storage needs of the business.

# Immediate Relative

Immediate Relative for the purpose of TCS Code, includes the spouse of Designated Person (mandatory); parent, sibling, and child of such DP or of the spouse, dependent financially on such DP, or consults such DP in taking decisions relating to trading in securities.

# Innovation Days

Focused workshops with a TCS customer where researchers and business leaders from both organizations participate to explore emerging technologies for specific customer problems.

# Innovation Forum

TCS’ thought leadership event that is held in major and emerging markets. It brings together researchers from academia, innovators from the start-up ecosystem, technology watchers, futurists and customers to brainstorm around emerging technologies.

# Inorganic Growth

An RFP is floated early in the procurement cycle and requested information may include basic corporate information and history, financial information, technical capability and estimated completion period, and customer references.

# Robotic Process Automation

The use of software tools to automate high-volume, repeatable tasks that previously required humans to perform. RPA is best suited for relatively simple and stable processes. Dynamic changes in the environment require ongoing upkeep of robots, diluting the economic benefit of the automation. Increasingly, customers are preferring cognitive automation over RPA.

# SBTi

Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) is a global organization that helps companies and financial institutions set emissions reduction targets aligned with climate science. It enables organizations worldwide to play their part in combating the climate crisis.

# Scope 1, Scope 2, Scope 3 emissions

Greenhouse gas emission accounting categories as per the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Scope 1 emissions includes direct emissions from operations. Scope 2 emissions are emissions from procured electricity, heat and steam. Scope 3 consists of value chain emissions (both upstream and downstream).

# Security Operations Center

A Security Operations Center is responsible for protecting an organization against cyber threats. SOC analysts perform round-the-clock monitoring of an organization’s network and investigate any potential security incidents.

# Shareholder Payout Ratio

The proportion of earnings paid to shareholders as a percentage of the company’s earnings, i.e. Net profit attributable to shareholders of the company. Payout can be in the form of dividend and share buyback, including taxes thereon.

# Simplification

The rationalization of IT architectures through consolidation of systems and elimination of redundant systems and layers. The primary purpose is to shrink the IT footprint and make operations leaner and more efficient.

# Software as a Service

Software as a Service (SaaS) is software that is owned, delivered and managed remotely by one or more providers. The provider delivers software based on one set of common code and data definitions that is consumed in a one-to-many model by all contracted customers at anytime on a pay-for-use basis or as a subscription based on use metrics.

# Sole Sourced Contract

Non-competitive agreements that allow a single vendor to fulfill the needs of the contractual requirements. These types of contracts can be won when the competitor set narrows down significantly and comes down to a single vendor discussion, given the nature of the client’s solution requirements.

# Special Economic Zone

In India, these are designated areas in which business and trade laws are different from the rest of the country, with various benefits and tax breaks to promote exports, attract investments, and create local jobs.

# Sustainable Development Goals

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity.

| Vendor Consolidation                    | A strategy to reduce costs and the overheads of managing a large number of vendors. Usually entails aggregating work currently outsourced to many small providers, and transferring it to a smaller, select set of winning bidders. Besides cost reduction, clients use this to reduce complexity and accelerate their cloud transformation journeys. Selecting a single strategic partner with end-to-end capabilities to maintain the legacy estate and support the modernization drives efficiency, accountability and speed. |

This engagement was conducted by a multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners, engineers and environmental and social professionals.

Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention to cause us to believe that the Company’s Identified Sustainability Information in pages 18 to 29, 127 to 164, and 319 to 325 of the Integrated Annual Report relating to select GRI and BRSR attributes (which are not part of BRSR Core) for the year ended 31 March 2025, is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the World Resource Institute (WRI) / World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol (A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standards), and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting &#x26; Reporting Standard, Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements (SEBI LODR) and with reference to the GRI Standards (2021) as per Reporting boundary set out in page no: 128 in BRSR section of the Integrated Annual Report.

# Basis for conclusion

We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and ISAE 3410, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Our responsibilities” section of our report.

We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA).

Integrated Annual Report 2024-25


# Sustainability Disclosures

KPMG Assurance and Consulting Services LLP (‘the firm’) applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements, issued by the IAASB. This standard requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management, including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.

# Other information

The Company’s management and the Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Company’s Integrated Annual Report (but does not include the select BRSR and GRI attributes and assurance report thereon).

Additionally, we have performed a reasonable assurance engagement on BRSR Core attributes and issued an independent assurance report on 27 May 2025. Our report thereon is included with the other information.

Our limited assurance conclusion on the select BRSR and GRI attributes does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our assurance report of the select BRSR and GRI attributes, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the select BRSR and GRI attributes, our knowledge obtained in the assurance, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this reasonable assurance report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Intended use or purpose

The ISI and our limited assurance report are intended for users who have reasonable knowledge of the BRSR and GRI attributes, the reporting criteria and ISI and who have read the information in the ISI with reasonable diligence and understand that the ISI is prepared and assured at appropriate levels of materiality.

Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.

Sustainability Disclosures

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the reporting process for the Company’s ISI.

# Inherent limitations

The preparation of the Company’s sustainability information requires the management to establish or interpret the criteria, make determinations about the relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported information.

Measurement of certain amounts with respect to BRSR and GRI attributes, some of which are estimates, is subject to substantial inherent measurement uncertainty, for example GHG footprint, water footprint, energy footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to support our opinion/conclusion does not reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics.

# Our responsibilities

We are responsible for:

- planning and performing the engagement to obtain a limited assurance about whether the ISI is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;
- forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained; and
- reporting our conclusion to the Board of Directors of TCS.

# Summary of the work we performed as the basis for our conclusion

We exercised professional judgement and maintained professional skepticism throughout the engagement. We designed and performed our procedures to obtain evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for limited assurance conclusion.

Our procedures selected depended on our understanding of the ISI covered by limited assurance and other engagement circumstances, and our consideration of areas where material misstatements are likely to arise. In carrying out our engagement, we:

- assessed the suitability of the criteria used by the Company in preparing the ISI covered by limited assurance;
- interviewed senior management and relevant staff at corporate and selected locations concerning policies for occupational health and safety, and the implementation of these across the business;
- through inquiries, obtained an understanding of TCS’s control environment, processes and information systems relevant to the preparation of the ISI covered by limited assurance, but did not evaluate the design of particular control activities, obtain evidence about their implementation or test their operating effectiveness;
- made inquiries of relevant staff at corporate and selected locations responsible for the preparation of the ISI covered by limited assurance;
- applied analytical procedures, as appropriate;
- recalculated the ISI covered by limited assurance based on the criteria; and
- evaluated the overall presentation of the ISI covered by limited assurance to determine whether it is consistent with the criteria and in line with our overall knowledge of, and experience with, the Company.

The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.

# Exclusions:

Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we will not express a conclusion on the same:

- Any form of review of the commercial merits, technical feasibility, accuracy, compliance with applicable legislation for the project, and accordingly we will express no opinion thereon. We will also not be required to verify any of the judgments and commercial risks associated with the project, nor comment upon the possibility of the financial projections being achieved. The Company’s statements that describe the strategy, progress on goals (other than those listed under the scope of assurance), expression of opinion, claims, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim to future intention provided by the Company, and assertions related to Intellectual Property Rights and other competitive issues.
