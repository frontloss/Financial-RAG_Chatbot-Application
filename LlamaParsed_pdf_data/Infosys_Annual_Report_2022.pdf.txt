# Integrated Annual Report 2022-23

NAVIGATING CHANGE AT THE PACE OF AI
The context surrounding an enterprise, created, and influenced by multiple inherently uncertain forces, can significantly impact the fortunes of a business. While this volatility has come to be expected as normal, not every business emerges from it having tackled the situation with the same resilience. Those that get a head start in preparing and taking on the challenges are also the ones that come out of the uncertainty with the ability to outperform in the recovery. That does not necessarily mean rethinking one’s business strategy, but rather rearticulating it to adapt. It’s really about being judicious where to lean in and where to pull back. In essence, it’s about protecting one’s capability to innovate and propel forward while being deeply disciplined when it comes to operations. Digitally transformed companies have a distinct advantage here. They can drive frictionless business throughout the supply chain, serve customers at lower costs, and avoid resource-intensive IT upgrades, unlike the digitally disadvantaged who may have to wait for economic conditions to improve before they can make progress.

Advanced technologies – especially AI in tandem with cloud – are creating performance opportunities that are reshaping these dynamics in significant ways. They are helping companies to amplify human potential to take on higher value work, boost people productivity and rapidly create business value. From unlocking efficiencies at scale and empowering the ecosystem to accelerating growth, cognitively capable companies are unshackling intelligence from data for experimentation as well as the scale-out of AI to power greater efficacy and create disruptive revenue streams.

Infosys is taking the AI-first approach to its own transformation. We are bringing the power of AI, analytics, and cloud to accelerate our own enterprise transformation, even as we build incremental value from micro-changes, to improve client service, reimagine business processes, and boost productivity. Nearly 50,000 reusable intelligent services, applied in over 25,000 instances, are amplifying our employees to boost their productivity.

It is Infosys Topazᵀᴹ – our AI-first services using generative AI – that’s making it all possible. Both for us and our clients. Today, 12,000+ AI use cases and 150+ pre-trained AI models delivered by AI-first specialists and data strategists are accelerating business value for enterprises the world over. All this, while ensuring uncompromising ethics, trust, privacy and compliance, and security of data and AI.

You’ll no doubt catch interesting glimpses of these exciting possibilities and progress in this Integrated Annual Report. It’s the same potential we see too, to help our clients navigate change and move into a future filled with more potential, and more shared advances.

BOOKING HOLDINGS: BOOSTING THE RISK-RESILIENCE OF BUSINESS

E-commerce fraud has evolved and increased with the surge in online commerce since the pandemic. Bad actors are launching more sophisticated attacks.

Booking Holdings is the world’s leading provider of online travel and related services, offered to consumers and local partners in more than 220 countries and territories through six primary consumer-facing brands: Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda, Rentalcars.com, KAYAK and OpenTable. Booking Holdings’ mission is to make it easier for everyone to experience the world.

Across their operations, Booking Holdings’ brands have always been keen to ensure comprehensive security powered by next-gen technology.

Efforts at Infosys strengthen this collaboration to build innovative solutions in the travel domain. Infosys is also looking to continuously upskill its project team to build exceptional skill sets that can be leveraged to build these focused solutions.

“Modern enterprises, with their digital footprint expanding past traditional perimeters, are increasingly susceptible to cybersecurity attacks. To be cyber-resilient, enterprises must embed security by design and operational measures to adequately protect products and services. To do this, they need to embrace AI-first threat management solutions. We have successfully adopted this approach at Booking Holdings and for our brands working collaboratively with Infosys.”

MS AMLIN: INSIGHTS TO NAVIGATE FROM RISK MANAGEMENT TO STRATEGIC RESILIENCE

Organizations in the insurance industry have recently been severely targeted by threat actors due to the huge volume of personally identifiable information and sensitive customer financial data. To date, more than 100 million users have had their personally identifiable information compromised in this sector, making cybersecurity an utmost priority. MS Amlin is a leading insurer and reinsurer and is part of the global top-10 insurance group MS&#x26;AD, with three main legal entities operating in the Lloyd’s, UK, Continental European and Bermudian markets. With a 300-year record, MS Amlin delivers quality service for businesses facing the most complex and demanding risks. Their areas of operation are mostly property &#x26; casualty, marine and reinsurance markets. MS Amlin has chosen Infosys as their cybersecurity service provider to ensure comprehensive security services powered by cognitive next-gen security operations.

Infosys offers enterprise-wide security controls to secure MS Amlin’s IT estate, including identity protection, network security, workplace and workload security, vulnerability management and governance, along with risk and compliance management. The platform-centric approach for security tools and controls are embedded with cognitive AI-modeled use cases and playbooks for advanced threat detection and response. Identity is now a crucial aspect of cybersecurity; if compromised, it can trigger many lethal server attacks. Infosys has, for MS Amlin, mitigated the risk of identity management by implementing SSO – single sign-on and reconciliation of privileged accounts. Infosys has also helped implement multi-factor authentication and privilege access management with industry-leading and best-of-breed products and solutions.

Network detection and response has also been operationalized for MS Amlin to get deep and detailed insights on the anomalies in their environment. Working in collaboration with MS Amlin, Infosys has been able to protect the business from evolving threats and elevate their security posture.

“Modern enterprises, with their digital footprint growing beyond traditional perimeters, are becoming soft targets for cybersecurity attacks. To be risk-resilient, enterprises must embed security by design and embrace next-gen cognitive threat management solutions. MS Amlin and Infosys Cybersecurity are working collaboratively to establish next-gen security operations for threat monitoring and incident response orchestration based on AI hypothesis.”

Chairman’s message

# Navigating uncertainty

If there is one overriding theme that defines our current world, it is that it is suffused with uncertainty. The placid and the predictable are behind us as each new day brings new inputs and new events that derail the carefully-crafted models we have constructed of the world around us. The cocktail of inflation, interest rates, geopolitics, war, demand volatility, supply chain dislocations, the shift from efficiency to resilience and security, all stirring quickly and without warning, is what’s before us. In any week, we may oscillate from caution to optimism and back to caution based on the news of the day.

Such times of intense uncertainty, great short-term pressure, and crunched resources require that companies must become better, more efficient in their ability to be resilient in the present while also securing their future growth. This is easier said than done. The extreme volatility that surrounds us creates so many probable future states, that it simply isn’t prudent for businesses to plan to succeed in any one anticipated future scenario. Instead, we need to develop the flexibility to be able to avoid limiting choices, reduce concentration risk, quickly adapt, and learn to thrive in any new reality.

The era of optionality is upon us.

Optionality can take various forms. In our IT infrastructure, it is the ability to dynamically reconfigure the way we work – remotely, in office or hybrid. In the area of talent, it is about building and deploying agile learning platforms so that our people can hone their skill sets to match new demand and new technologies. It is about having a digital-first and AI-first business architecture which can be constantly configured. It is finding the right balance between retaining the core of a company and working with partners on others. Optionality must be ingrained in strategy and execution.

Our CEO, Salil Parekh, and his global leadership team, realized early on the value that advanced digital technologies like AI and cloud, and more recently, generative AI, can bring to imagine and execute for multiple options in the future. They came together as One Infosys to orchestrate teams that lead the charge to continually transform Infosys into an organization that truly realizes human-machine synergies, from fundamentally rethinking organizational design to segmenting cognitive tasks to get the right balance between people, technology, and process. Today, Infosys is steadily progressing towards a future where we don’t just solve immediate business problems, but continually innovate and architect for challenges that may emerge in the future. We build it for ourselves first, and then, deeply rooted in our own experience, take it widely to our clients.

The awesome possibilities of generative AI, we know from our own journey to becoming an AI-first enterprise, is not without its risks. The problems of AI hallucination, systemic biases, lack of explainability along with plenty of practical, ethical and intellectual property-related issues remain open and up for debate. We also know, from our experience, that the path to scaling AI enterprise-wide is non-linear. Often, organizations, seeking to mine value from data and AI models, successfully undertake pilots but fail to factor in what it will take to scale value across the whole enterprise. As demands increase, data volumes grow, and complexity rises, companies find themselves unable to surmount the associated challenges and start to question the path to value. Navigating to value-at-scale from AI and retaining the larger strategic vision while breaking down the tasks into sequential small wins, is not always intuitive or simple.

With our AI-first strategy, Infosys is guided by that road map. We are also bringing to our global clients the ability to accelerate business value and amplify human potential using AI technologies with Infosys Topazᵀᴹ.

The digital transformation of every industry and every business, over the last several years, has laid the foundation to create optionality as we navigate the way forward. Our clients have always trusted us to assist them not only to make the right digital investments but to safeguard these investments for their future. Today, we are excited by the opportunity and humbled by the responsibility we have to enable them to bring all their digital capabilities together to execute quickly and effectively for now, while developing multiple options to amplify their competitive advantage and market leadership in an uncertain future.

Our client relevance has never been so compelling, our investment in employees as continuous and consistent, and our purpose so keen. We are ready to co-create with our clients and our entire ecosystem a flexible future that puts people first and benefits the broader society even as it propels business forward. After all, like many have said, imagination is our invisible power to create all things. Our future can be as bright as we imagine it to be.

Performance overview

# Letter to the Shareholder

Dear shareholder,

Financial year 2023 was a strong year for our business. In FY23, we saw growth of over 15%, operating margins of 21%, and free cash flow of US$2.5 billion. Our attrition reduced for each quarter of the year.

With the changing economic environment, we positioned our Company to work with clients for their digital transformation as well as their cost efficiency and automation programs, enabling us to support them in two critical areas of interest.

We have developed a strong set of capabilities in generative artificial intelligence to enhance how we enable our clients to derive value. These capabilities are available to all our clients in the form of Infosys Topazᵀᴹ.

Our Cobalt capabilities for the cloud continue to resonate with our clients. Our platforms, including Finacle for banks, McCamish for insurance, Equinox for commerce, and Helix for healthcare, are creating strong impact with clients.

During the year, we were recognized by Brand Finance among the top three most valuable IT services brands globally.

We continue to deepen our engagement with our clients. The number of clients with over US$100 million in revenue for the year was at 40. The number of clients with over US$50 million in revenue for the year was at 75. Our large deal intensity was strong during the year. We had 95 large deals with a value of US$9.8 billion in the year. We see our One Infosys approach helping support our clients by bringing all our capabilities and the strength of our entire employee-base to work for their benefit.

We recruited over 50,000 college graduates in the year and ended the year with over 3,40,000 employees. At the end of the year, 39% of our employees were women.

Our learning ecosystem enabled over 5.5 million learning days for our employees during the year.

Last year we returned US$3.1 billion to our shareholders – US$1.7 billion as dividend and US$1.4 billion through our share buyback program.

At the end of the financial year, we were the leading company among our peers in total shareholder return over the past five years.

We remain committed to the communities we live and operate in. With the work of Infosys Foundation, we support a variety of social causes, including creating positive impact in healthcare, education, sustainability, and women empowerment. Our Infosys Springboard initiative continues to help build digital skills by providing free learning programs to millions of people around the world.

In the past few quarters, we have seen the global economy dealing with inflation, interest rate increases, and changes in demand environment for companies in various industries. Our strength in digital, cloud, and in automation, along with cost efficiency capabilities have held us in good stead. These will continue to be critical in the evolving economic environment.

As I look ahead, given the trust of our clients, the dedication of our employees, the strength of our capabilities, our One Infosys approach, and the guidance of our Board, I remain confident of our ability to serve our clients and continue to create impact for them.

With my warmest regards,

Sd/-

The journey to the digital future requires not just an understanding of new technologies and new ways of working, but a deep appreciation of existing technology landscapes, business processes and practices. Our strategy is to be a navigator for our clients as they ideate, plan and execute on their journey to a digital future.

In 2018, we embraced a four-pronged strategy to strengthen our relevance with clients and drive accelerated value creation:

1. Scale agile digital
2. Energize the core
3. Reskill our people
4. Expand localization

We believe the investments we have made, and continue to make, in our strategy will enable us to advise and help our clients as they tackle the current market conditions. Further, we have been able to successfully enable most of our employees worldwide to work remotely and securely – giving us the operational stability to deliver on client commitments and ensuring our own business continuity.

Over the last few years, we have executed on this strategy and generated significant outcomes.

# Scale agile digital

Our revenue from digital technology related services and solutions has more than doubled in the last three years, and now comprises 62.2% of our total revenue. We are rated as a “leader” in 56 industry analyst ratings across our digital offerings. These outcomes are a result of investments we have made to expand our digital footprint via reskilling of our employees, targeted acquisitions, strong ecosystem partnerships, innovation experience centers across the world, intellectual property development, reconfiguring our workspaces for agile software development and enhancing our brand.

During the fiscal, we completed the acquisition of oddity to augment our human experience capabilities in Europe. Through our academia partnerships with Purdue, Trinity, RISD and eCornell, we have trained over 7,500 employees in niche digital skills.

# Energize the core

Leveraging automation and AI, we are winning and executing several engagements for our clients to modernize their core legacy technology and process landscapes. We made significant investments in our “Live Enterprise” platform, including our Bot Factory of preconfigured automation bots and Live Enterprise Application Management Platform (LEAP), our platform for optimizing large scale application maintenance and reengineering.

In fiscal 2023, we won a total contract value of over US$ 9.8 billion in large deals, continuing to demonstrate our capabilities and competitiveness in executing complex transformation programs. In addition, investments in our own internal systems, reimagination of our internal processes and automation of software development processes have helped increase our agility, boost productivity and enhance our competitiveness even in the current paradigm of remote working.

# Reskill our people

Continuous learning and reskilling has always been integral to our operating model. We operate our reskilling program with the twin objectives of increasing fulfillment of demand for digital skills in client projects and for enriching the expertise of our global workforce in next generation technologies and methodologies. We invested in, and scaled, our digital reskilling program globally. Our programs now also encompass latest courses on generative AI landscape.

Lex, our in-house developed, anytime-anywhere-learning platform, offers over 14,800 courses curated for easy consumption on mobile devices with advanced telemetry, gamification and certification features. Over 3,25,000 of our employees use Lex and are spending approximately 3.3 million training days compared to 2.3 million in the last fiscal. Our platforms are also being enhanced with generative AI aspects.

# Expand localization

With the objective of creating differentiated talent pools and ecosystems in our markets, we made significant investments in expanding our local workforce in the United States, UK, Europe, Japan, China, Canada and Australia. We established innovation hubs, near-shore centers and digital design studios across geographies. Further, we expanded our university and community college partnerships in all these regions to aid internships, recruitment, training and joint research. In fiscal 2023, we recruited over 10,169 employees locally in our markets, of which 2,216 were fresh graduates.

# Looking ahead

To continue staying relevant to the emerging needs of our clients, we prioritize:

- Scaling our cloud capabilities, especially around cloud advisory, data on cloud, cloud security, SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and private cloud;
- Expanding capabilities in key digital technology areas such as AI, product engineering, cybersecurity and human experience;
- Strengthening our employee value proposition for the newer contexts of work and workplace;
- Running our operations in a cost-effective and agile manner;
- Delivering on our ESG commitments, while at the same time enabling our clients to realize their sustainability goals.

Our hybrid work model is about our people and their comfort. It offers the flexibility of working from home, working from office or a combination of the two. The model operates according to different employee contexts: those in the same city as their office, those in other locations, and other situations. As part of this strategy, this year, we set up offices in Hubballi, Indore, Navi Mumbai, Nagpur and Coimbatore, in India.

# Delivering value

# Natural Capital

We have been at the forefront of climate action, starting well before international treaties and global commitments came into place. Our environmental performance over the past decade is a testimony to the fact that economic progress can go hand in hand with environmental sustainability. Infosys became carbon-neutral in 2020 – 30 years ahead of the timeline set by the Paris Agreement.

- As a part of our ESG Vision 2030, we have committed to maintaining carbon neutrality across Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, every year
- Signatory to the Climate Pledge, with the ultimate goal of a Net Zero planet by 2040
- Our goals are aligned to Science Based Targets (SBTi)

# Climate action strategy

We are working diligently towards this goal and built our carbon neutral program on three pillars –

- Energy efficiency
- Renewable energy
- Carbon offsets

# Water stewardship

As a signatory to the CEO Water Mandate, we commit to enhancing our operational water conservation procedures and expanding our community outreach. Infosys’ strategy to reduce water demand, recycle 100% wastewater and focus on rainwater harvesting have resulted in significant reduction in our water intensity. An important element of our water management system is rainwater harvesting (RWH). We have established around 400 deep injection wells across India campuses, providing a combined recharge capacity of around 20 million liters per day. We have also built 39 lakes across our campuses, holding 426 million liters of rainwater storage capacity.

# Biodiversity

A saga of greening. A significant and proven way to tackle climate change is to increase green cover by planting trees. Infosys Mangaluru offers a striking example of this, where barren land has been transformed into a lush green campus with thriving biodiversity of flora and fauna. The story of this transformation, along with documentation of the tree species in the campus, was recently published as a book. With this, we hope to inspire corporates, developers, administrators and communities to adopt similar projects at scale.

# Radiant cooling

Infosys has been a pioneer in radiant cooling technology. Our building in Hyderabad was the first radiant cooled commercial building in India. The building provided a global case study comparing two cooling technologies in a single building with identical conditions. Data over the past 12 years has shown that radiant cooling is about 35% more efficient than conventional air conditioning. Today, Infosys has implemented radiant cooling in over 5 million sq.ft. of office space across its buildings in India.

# Public cloud adoption

Currently, more than 68% of the internal IT application workload has been migrated to public cloud. All our employees have been enabled for cloud-based collaboration for messaging, presence, video, and other requirements. The shift to cloud helped in optimizing the on-premises data center footprint. This strategic shift also helped to scale up the infra on demand and provision IT services seamlessly for all the new hires inducted to the organization.

Capital Allocation Policy

Effective fiscal 2020, the Company expects to return approximately 85% of the free cash flow cumulatively over a five-year period through a combination of semi-annual dividends and / or share buyback and / or special dividends, subject to applicable laws and requisite approvals, if any. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditure, as per the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows prepared under IFRS. Dividend and buyback include applicable taxes.

In line with the Capital Allocation Policy, the Board, at its meeting held on October 13, 2022, approved the buyback of equity shares, from the open market route through the Indian stock exchanges, amounting to ₹9,300 crore (Maximum Buyback Size, excluding buyback tax) at a price not exceeding ₹1,850 per share (Maximum Buyback Price), subject to shareholders’ approval. The shareholders approved the proposal of buyback of equity shares recommended by the Board of Directors by way of postal ballot through e-voting and the result of which was declared on December 3, 2022.

The buyback was offered to all equity shareholders of the Company (other than the Promoters, the Promoter Group and Persons in Control of the Company) under the open market route through the stock exchanges. The buyback of equity shares through the stock exchanges commenced on December 7, 2022 and was completed on February 13, 2023. During this buyback period, the Company purchased and extinguished a total of 6,04,26,348 equity shares from the stock exchanges at a volume weighted average buyback price of ₹1,539.06 per equity share comprising 1.44% of the pre-buyback paid-up equity share capital of the Company. The buyback resulted in a cash outflow of ₹9,300 crore (excluding transaction costs and tax on buyback).

The Company funded the buyback from its free reserves including Securities Premium Account as explained in Section 68 of the Companies Act, 2013. In accordance with Section 69 of the Companies Act, 2013, as at March 31, 2023, the Company has created a Capital Redemption Reserve of ₹30 crore equal to the nominal value of the shares bought back as an appropriation from the general reserve and retained earnings.

During the year ended March 31, 2023, the Company paid an interim dividend of ₹16.5 per share and announced a final dividend of ₹17.5 per share, subject to shareholders’ approval in the ensuing AGM. After returning the above amounts, the Company would have returned approximately 86% of the cumulative free cash flow for fiscals 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 through dividends and buybacks, in line with the Capital Allocation Policy.

The Capital Allocation Policy is available on our website, at https://www.infosys.com/investors/corporate-governance/documents/capital-allocation-policy.pdf.

# Liquidity

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, investments and the cash flow that we generate from our operations. We continue to be debt-free and maintain sufficient cash to meet our strategic and operational requirements. We understand that liquidity in the Balance Sheet has to balance between earning adequate returns and the need to cover financial and business requirements. Liquidity enables us to be agile and ready for meeting unforeseen strategic and business needs, and opportunities.

As of March 31, 2023, we had ₹24,640 crore in working capital on a standalone basis, and ₹31,695 crore on a consolidated basis. Consolidated cash and investments stand at ₹22,509 crore on a standalone basis and ₹31,286 crore on a consolidated basis as on March 31, 2023, as against ₹29,950 crore on a standalone basis, and ₹37,419 crore on a consolidated basis as on March 31, 2022.

Consolidated cash and investments, on both standalone and consolidated basis, include deposits with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings by international and domestic credit rating agencies. As a result, liquidity risk of cash and cash equivalents is limited. Ratings are monitored periodically. Liquid assets also include investments in liquid mutual fund units, target maturity funds units, certificates of deposit (CDs), commercial paper (CP), quoted bonds issued by government and quasi-government organizations, and non-convertible debentures. CDs and CPs represent marketable securities of banks, NBFCs and eligible financial institutions for a specified time period with high credit rating given by domestic credit rating agencies. G-secs are highly liquid and marketable instruments issued across tenure, backed by Government of India carrying a sovereign credit. Investments made in non-convertible debentures are issued by government-owned institutions and financial institutions with high credit rating. We invest after considering counterparty risks based on multiple criteria including Tier-I capital, capital adequacy ratio, credit rating, profitability, NPA levels and deposit base of banks and financial institutions.

The details of these investments are disclosed under the ‘non-current and current investments’ section in the Standalone and Consolidated financial statements in this Integrated Annual Report.

# Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR)

In November 2018, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) constituted a Committee on Business Responsibility Reporting (“the Committee”) to finalize business responsibility reporting formats for listed and unlisted companies, based on the framework of the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC). Through its report, the Committee recommended that BRR be rechristened BRSR, where disclosures are based on ESG parameters, compelling organizations to holistically engage with stakeholders and go beyond regulatory compliances in terms of business measures and their reporting.

The BRSR disclosures form a part of this Integrated Annual Report. The non-financial sustainability disclosures have been independently assured by KPMG.

# Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)

In October 2020, we launched our ESG Vision 2030. Our focus is steadfast on leveraging technology to battle climate change, water management and waste management. On the social front, our emphasis is on the development of people, especially in the areas of digital skilling, improving diversity and inclusion, facilitating employee wellness and experience, delivering technology for good and energizing the communities we work in. We are also redoubling our efforts to serve the interests of all our stakeholders, by leading through our core values and setting benchmarks in corporate governance.

The ESG Committee was constituted by the Board with effect from April 14, 2021, to discharge its oversight responsibility on matters related to organization-wide ESG initiatives, priorities, and leading ESG practices. The ESG Committee reports to the Board and meets every quarter to review progress on the ESG ambitions articulated in our ESG Vision 2030.

# Annexure 3 – Particulars of employees

We are a leading provider of consulting, technology, outsourcing and next-generation digital services. We enable clients across 56 countries to outperform their competition and stay ahead on the innovation curve. The remuneration and perquisites provided to our employees, including that of the Management, are on par with industry benchmarks. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee continuously reviews the compensation of our CEO and other Key Managerial Personnel (KMP) to align both the short-term and long-term business objectives of the Company and to link compensation with the achievement of goals.

The details of remuneration to directors, KMP and other employees are in compliance with Rule 5 of Chapter XIII, the Companies (Appointment and Remuneration of Managerial Personnel) Rules, 2014. In accordance with the requirements, tables 3(a) and 3(b) include the perquisite value of stock incentives at the time of their exercise and do not include the value of the stock incentives at the time of grant.

The change in remuneration in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 is primarily on account of change in perquisite value of stock incentives granted in previous years and exercised during the year, and higher stock incentives exercised in certain cases and change in cash compensation. The change in perquisite value of stock incentives exercised during the year also includes the impact of change in share price during the period of exercise.

# 4. Executive summary and web link(s) of Impact Assessment reports

# Overview:

The Company fulfils its CSR ambitions and initiatives, both through its internal CSR volunteers &#x26; groups and through the Infosys Foundation – a not-for-profit entity. Given the scale and impact of the CSR projects, a robust methodology for documenting the objectives and corresponding measurement criteria has been identified and implemented. This document includes:

# Key objectives:

- Obtain insights into projects to determine the overall effectiveness and impact;
- Use measurable indicators to gauge progress of grantee organizations in meeting their intended milestones and long-term goals;
- Provide frameworks, metrics and tools for ongoing evaluation, monitoring, and design;
- Provide recommendations for decision-making for grants; and
- Serve as a guidepost for future projects.

# Methodology:

Results will be measured through a process-outcome evaluation focused on generating appropriate evidence through four key channels:

1. Key informant interviews: These are in-depth interviews with individuals who have first-hand knowledge about the projects, the underlying need, the people/community served by the project, and the intended use of the grant. These interviews are conducted in two rounds – prior to the actual site visit and then as a summative exercise to triangulate the nature of the findings.
2. Site visits: These are in-person visits to the project or program sites and the surrounding communities to gather information based on a checklist of program milestones. These visits and discussions facilitate the research team to come up with observations, and or draw conclusions.
3. Secondary data analysis: This is a desk-based analysis of data from grantee organizations on the usage of grant, timelines, and monitoring data using management information systems (MIS), photographs, press releases, among others.
4. End user surveys: These are face-to-face, web-based, or telephone-based interactions with end users or beneficiaries of projects. The data thus gathered from primary and secondary sources is analyzed and triangulated to present a comprehensive assessment of project outcomes and implementation processes.

The executive summary includes details of 16 CSR projects considered for impact assessment, conducted by LEAD @ Krea University (1).

(1) LEAD at Krea University (Leveraging Evidence for Access and Development) is research centre that is part of IFMR (The Institute for Financial Management and Research) Society.

Annexure 7 – Conservation of energy, research and development, technology absorption, foreign exchange earnings and outgo

# Particulars pursuant to the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014

Our focused approach on energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon offset projects over the years resulted in Infosys achieving carbon neutrality for four years in a row since fiscal 2020, across all emissions, as per PAS 2060:2014 standards. We continue to remain carbon neutral for fiscal 2023, aligning to global commitments, and supporting the global response to the threat of climate change.

# Resource conservation initiatives

Conservation of natural resources (energy, water) is important to maintain ecological balance and make them available for future generations, and help protect the environment. Resource conservation initiatives at Infosys have been focused, continuous and imbibed in our operations and new infrastructure development. The introduction of highly efficient new buildings, major improvements in current buildings, intelligent automation, water management plans, and waste treatment and management projects have greatly reduced our environmental impact. We have been able to expand our business while keeping resource intensity low.

Increased adoption of renewable energy in our operations has helped avoiding our emissions, and our high-impact carbon offset projects have enabled us to offset unavoidable emissions.

# Energy

Every new building at Infosys follows the industry best standards and practices for energy efficiency. Improving energy efficiency can not only lower utility bills but also reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly. Our two-pronged strategy of constructing highly efficient new buildings and operational excellence in existing buildings has significantly minimized the energy intensity. Smart automation continues to play a key role in remote operations management and build resilience in the system. We strive to exceed expectations by establishing new standards and introducing creative systems into our structures, thus conserving energy.

The capital investment in energy conservation projects was `3 crore in fiscal 2023.

The visit of the G20 delegation (Energy Transition Working Group) to Infosys campus, Bengaluru to witness energy conservation techniques deployed on the campus, is a testimony to our advocacy efforts beyond our boundary, and positively impacting global climate action.

# Renewable energy

We have a total capacity of 60 MW of solar PV, including rooftop and ground-mounted systems. We continue to pursue green power purchase from third-party power producers and engage with power distribution companies for enabling green tariff. We also work with governments to enable favorable policies for scaling up green power by corporates in India. We have also embarked on a journey to source green power for some of our leased international locations.

# Green buildings

In fiscal 2023, our leased facility in Pune and our buildings in Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad were awarded the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) Platinum certification. As part of workplace transformation, buildings with interior retrofitting received IGBC’s Green Interiors rating, even though they had already been certified as part of the campus green certification process. We now have 46 projects at Infosys with the highest level of green building certification, spanning a total area of 28.9 million sq.ft.

# Transformed workplace

As part of interior retrofits, several buildings were transformed in fiscal 2023 to improve employee experience and productivity in the new hybrid working environment. Sustainability has been one of the main principles in design, giving importance to materials selection and equipment efficiency, among other aspects, so as to make our workplaces employee friendly as well as environment friendly.

# Water management

Reduce, recycle and reuse of water through demand side measures and implementing efficient technology has enabled freshwater conservation. The state-of-the-art sewage treatment plants of tertiary treatment capabilities enable zero discharge of wastewater from our campuses. We have initiated lake rejuvenation projects near our campus, that will enhance water availability in the surroundings, with additional expected benefits such as improved health, reduced flooding and enhance biodiversity.

# Waste management

Infosys adopts the principles of Circular Economy, based on Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Repurpose approach. We seek to uphold our ambition of ‘zero waste to landfill’ through active minimization combined with technology investment in recycling and streamlining systems and processes. TRUE certification for zero waste, aimed at diversion of all non-hazardous solid waste from landfill is being adopted by some of our campuses. We focused on diversion of some of the identified waste going for incineration into co-processing, which refers to the simultaneous recycling of mineral materials and recovery of energy within one single industrial process of cement production.

# Carbon offsets

After reducing and avoiding emissions to the maximum extent possible, there are unavoidable emissions that need to be addressed through the carbon offset program. Infosys continues to identify projects that have a high social impact – improving health and livelihoods of rural families, creating rural jobs, etc., and along the way, also generating carbon offsets for the Company. Our unique offset program is certified to the highest level (Gold Standard) in quality, authenticity and transparency.

This year, we added new cookstove projects in Rajasthan, and biogas projects in Maharashtra and Karnataka. While the cookstove projects improve health of people in the households through low-smoke, low-firewood use, the household biogas units benefit the families by minimizing the fuel cost and utilizing

Annexures to the Βoard's report

# Carbon offset program

Our carbon offset program is spread across six states in India, and has benefited 2,40,000 + rural families, and created over 2,800 rural jobs.

# Carbon neutral events

Infosys has envisioned to organize global events to promote our best practices in carbon neutrality. All measures are taken to promote environmental protection, including the use of eco-friendly materials, no plastic, and conservation of energy and water. A precise assessment of the carbon emissions resulting from the event is done and the emissions are balanced out by our carbon offset initiatives. In fiscal 2023, six events organized by Infosys were declared carbon neutral.

# Infosys Mangaluru campus

From barren land to a verdant campus: One of the most significant and proven steps to tackle climate change is increasing the green cover through tree plantation. Trees are effective in cleansing the air, securing the soil and limiting erosion, resulting in improved water management.

We created a two-volume book that outlines the process of transforming a barren piece of land on the outskirts of Mangaluru into a lush green campus with a diverse array of flora and fauna. The book highlights the approach and methodology, and the scientific way in which greening of the campus was achieved on a large scale within a brief span of time. The book is expected to be a repository of the endemic species of the Western Ghats, for academicians and the scientific community. The book demonstrates the transformation that is possible, and intends to inspire corporations, developers, administration and communities towards biodiversity preservation and green transformation.

# Core backend infrastructure

To enable this, our core backend infrastructure was transformed to host modern applications, using the scalability of cloud, security of on-premise infrastructure in a hybrid cloud deployment using open source technologies with highly scalable container orchestration solutions like Kubernetes for microservices. Telemetry infrastructure using the ELK stack provided enhanced real-time visibility and enabled proactive error detection and correction.

# Modern, hybrid, and secure workplace

Our hybrid workplace ecosystem brings together technologies such as borderless ODCs, virtual collaboration tools, and self-service applications to provide our employees much-needed flexibility to work from anywhere. Our robust IT management system minimizes threats and prevents attacks, through a continuous cycle of vulnerability assessment and remediation, to safeguard our data and brand reputation.

# Cloud-native application platform

As part of modernizing applications, some applications need to be exposed to different user bases with varied authentication mechanisms. The cloud-native application platform gives the capabilities in a ready-to-use architecture. This enables quick onboarding of applications with industry-standard security along with greater scalability and availability using the power of cloud.

# Energy-efficient IT infrastructure

We have adopted a multi-pronged strategy to make our computer workload energy-efficient and environment-friendly. Some of the measures implemented are:

# Public cloud adoption

68% of the internal IT applications have been migrated to the public cloud. All our employees have been enabled for cloud-based collaboration platform for messaging, presence, video, and other requirements.

# Data center modernization

A strategic initiative launched by InfosysIT to modernize the data center IT landscape to make it future-ready, continues to yield high rewards. Density-optimized hyperscale platforms were deployed to enable high-density server virtualization and consolidation across the enterprise. Hyperscale platforms are open-driven infrastructure innovations that enable cloud-scale agility and efficient resource pooling and utilization. This initiative is expected to deliver power savings and reduce the total cost of ownership for the organization.

# Technology absorption

Live Enterprise: An enterprise that senses, feels and responds in real-time – this was the theme of our transformation journey of the past three years. It had to be a mobile-first approach so that employees were connected to the organization wherever they were in the world and could access the organization’s assets to learn and contribute. The response has been phenomenal – the InfyMe mobile app, with 250+ features, has been downloaded by more than 2,78,000 users, and more than 44,000 users have rated it 4.7/5 on Google Play Store. With process bursting, we have seen many of our key processes become faster – the Live Enterprise platform has itself been built on the latest open source stack. After the internal success, we are also seeing interest for the platform among our clients as seven clients have already been onboarded and many more are in discussions.

# Enterprise storage

We provide around 1.8PB of storage capacity for employees, revenue projects, and internal requirements on all flash storage with fabric pool and storage grid technology. Data is marked hot and cold based on policy. Cold data is automatically moved to cheaper, larger capacity storage, resulting in data tiering and savings in terms of data center footprint, power consumption, and cooling.

# Cloud-native development environment

The open source-based cloud-native development platform is built on Hyper Converged Infrastructure (HCI) and compute which has helped reduce data center footprint and power and cooling consumption.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-23



# Management’s discussion and analysis

# 6. Other assets

Unbilled revenues are classified as non-financial asset where the right to consideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones. Unbilled increase is mainly attributable to complex and integrated large deals. Withholding taxes and others represent credits that can be availed against local taxes payable in various countries. Deferred contract cost mainly comprises the cost of obtaining a contract and the cost of fulfilling a contract recorded in accordance with Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

# 7. Deferred tax assets / liabilities

Net deferred tax asset comprising deferred tax assets less deferred tax liabilities has decreased primarily on account of temporary difference in the Special Economic Zone Re-investment Reserve, deferred tax liability on intangibles from business combination partially offset by deferred tax asset on post-sales client support, allowances for trade receivables and compensated absences.

# 8. Income tax assets / liabilities

Our net profit earned from providing software development and other services outside India is subject to tax in the country where we perform the work. Most of our taxes paid in countries other than India can be claimed as credit against our tax liabilities in India.

We provide for provident fund to eligible employees of Infosys, which is a defined benefit plan as the Company has an obligation to make good the shortfall, if any, between the return from the investments of the trust and the notified interest rate. The Company operates the defined benefit pension plan in certain overseas jurisdictions, in accordance with local laws. These plans are managed by third-party fund managers. We provide for gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan (“the Gratuity Plan”), covering eligible employees in India. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation, or termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee’s salary and the tenure of employment. We also operate defined benefit pension plan in certain overseas jurisdictions, in accordance with the local laws. These plans are managed by third-party fund managers. The plans provide for periodic payouts after retirement and / or a lumpsum payment as set out in rules of each fund and includes death and disability benefits.

# 11. Provisions

Provision for post-sales client support is towards likely cost for providing client support to fixed-price and fixed-timeframe contracts.

# 12. Leases

Additions mainly comprise lease of computers and building taken on lease in certain locations in India.

# 9. Financial liabilities

Liabilities for accrued compensation to employees include the provision for bonus, accrued salaries, incentives and retention bonus payable to the staff. Financial liability under option arrangements represents redemption liability towards Stater, Infosys Compaz and HIPUS acquisitions to purchase the corresponding minority stake. Accrued expenses represent amounts accrued for other operational expenses. Retention monies represent monies withheld on contractor payments, pending final acceptance of their work. Compensated absences are both accumulating and non-accumulating in nature. The expected cost of accumulating compensated absences is determined by actuarial valuation. Other financial liability includes financing arrangements entered into by the Company with a third party towards deferred contract cost assets.

# Management’s discussion and analysis

# 1. Revenue

The growth in our revenues in fiscal 2023 from fiscal 2022 is as follows:

| Particulars | Standalone | 2023     | 2022 | % change | Consolidated | 2023 | 2022 | % change |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------- | ---- | -------- | ------------ | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| Revenue     | 1,24,014   | 1,03,940 | 19.3 | 1,46,767 | 1,21,641     | 20.7 |      |          |

The increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in digital revenues, large deal wins and volume increases across most of the segments.

The revenues from digital and core services for fiscals 2023 and 2022 are as follows:

| Particulars | Consolidated | 2023 | 2022 | % change |        |      |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---- | ---- | -------- | ------ | ---- |
| Digital     |              |      |      | 91,272   | 69,404 | 31.5 |
| Core        |              |      |      | 55,495   | 52,237 | 6.2  |

Revenue growth in reported terms includes impact of currency fluctuations. We, therefore, additionally report the revenue growth in constant currency terms, which represents the real growth in revenue excluding the impact of currency fluctuations. We calculate constant currency growth by comparing current period revenues in respective local currencies converted to INR using prior-period exchange rates and comparing the same to our prior-period reported revenues. Our revenues in reported currency terms for fiscal 2023 is US$ 18,212 million, a growth of 11.7%. Our revenues for fiscal 2023 in constant currency grew by 15.4%.

We added 458 new customers (gross) during fiscal 2023 as compared to 451 new customers (gross) during fiscal 2022. On a consolidated basis, for the year ended March 31, 2023, approximately 97.4% were export revenues whereas 2.6% were domestic revenues, while for the year ended March 31, 2022, 97.1% were export revenues whereas 2.9% were domestic revenues. Refer to the ‘Segmental profitability’ section in this report for more details on the analysis of segment revenues.

# 2. Expenditure

# Cost of sales

The cost of efforts, comprising employee cost and cost of technical sub-contractors, has increased as a percentage of revenue from 60.7% in fiscal 2022 to 61.6% in fiscal 2023 on a standalone basis and from 57.6% in fiscal 2022 to 58.0% in fiscal 2023 on a consolidated basis. The cost of efforts has increased mainly on account of compensation increase, increase in headcount and higher onsite mix partially offset by decrease in sub-contractors cost.

Third-party items bought for service delivery to clients include software and hardware which are integral to our overall service delivery to clients.

# Selling and marketing expenses

The selling and marketing expenses on standalone basis have remained unchanged as a percentage of revenue during fiscal 2023 at 4.0%, and have increased on consolidated basis during fiscal 2023 to 4.3% from 4.2% in fiscal 2022, mainly on account of increase in branding and marketing expenses and travelling costs partially offset by decrease in employee benefit costs.

# General and administration expenses

The general and administration expenses on standalone and consolidated basis have reduced as a percentage of revenue during fiscal 2023 to 4.3% from 4.6% in fiscal 2022, and 4.9% during fiscal 2023 from 5.3% in fiscal 2022, respectively, mainly on account of a decrease in employee benefit costs and consulting and professional expenses partially offset by increase in travel expenses.

# 3. Other income and finance cost

Other income primarily includes income from investments, gain / loss on investments, foreign exchange gain / loss on forward and options contracts and foreign exchange gain / loss on translation of other assets and liabilities. In fiscal 2023, the Company received ₹1,463 crore of dividend from our subsidiary, which is reflected in the Standalone financial statements.

Interest income in fiscal 2023 has increased as compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to a increase in yield on investments. We use foreign exchange forward and options contracts to hedge our exposure against movements in foreign exchange rates. Finance cost is on account of leases. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of these leases.




# 4. Provision for tax

We have provided for our tax liability both in India and overseas. The applicable Indian corporate statutory tax rate for both the years ended March 31, 2023, and March 31, 2022 is 34.94%.

| Particulars                     | Standalone | Consolidated |       |       |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ----- | ----- |
|                                 | 2023       | 2022         | 2023  | 2022  |
| Income tax expense (In ₹ crore) | 8,375      | 7,260        | 9,214 | 7,964 |
| Effective tax rate (In %)       | 26.5       | 25.5         | 27.7  | 26.4  |

Effective tax rate is generally influenced by various factors, including differential tax rates, non-deductible expenses, exempt non-operating income, overseas taxes, benefits from SEZ units, tax reversals and provisions pertaining to prior periods primarily on account of adjudication of certain disputed matters, filing of tax return and completion of assessments, across various jurisdictions.

# 5. Segmental profitability

The Company’s operations predominantly relate to providing end-to-end business solutions to enable clients to enhance performance of their business. Business segments of the Company are primarily enterprises in Financial Services and Insurance; enterprises in Manufacturing; enterprises in Retail, Consumer Packaged Goods and Logistics; enterprises in the Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services; enterprises in Communication, Telecom OEM and Media; enterprises in Hi-Tech; enterprises in Life Sciences and Healthcare; and all other segments. All other segments represent the operating segments of businesses in India, Japan, China, Infosys Public Services and other enterprises in public services. This is discussed in detail in Note 2.26 to the Consolidated financial statements in this Integrated Annual Report.

# Business segments – Consolidated

| Particulars                    | Financial Services |        | Retail | Communication | Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services | Manufacturing | Hi-Tech | Life Sciences | All other segments | Total    |

The following graph sets forth our revenue by geography:

|                   | 2023 (In ₹ crore) | 2022 (In ₹ crore) |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| North America     | 90,724 (61.8%)    | 75,058 (61.7%)    |
| Europe            | 14,507 (9.9%)     | 12,869 (10.6%)    |
| Rest of the World | 3,861 (2.6%)      | 3,585 (2.9%)      |
| India             | 37,675 (25.7%)    | 30,129 (24.8%)    |
| Total             | 1,46,767          | 1,21,641          |

Growth in %: Europe - 25.0, India - 7.7, Rest of the World - 12.7, Total - 20.7

Overall segment profitability has decreased primarily on account of decrease in utilization, increase in employee compensation and higher spend on third-party software and travel partially offset by benefit on account of cost optimization initiatives and currency fluctuations.

# 6. Liquidity

Our principal source of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and cash flow that we generate from operations. We have no outstanding borrowings. We believe our working capital is sufficient for our requirements.

Our growth has been financed largely through cash generated from operations. Our cash flows are robust. Our operating cash flows have decreased in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 mainly on account of outflow in working capital and higher income tax payments.

Consolidated cash and investments of ₹31,286 crore comprise cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current investments excluding investments in unquoted equity and preference shares and others.



Management’s discussion and analysis

# Capital Allocation Policy

Refer to the Board’s report in this Integrated Annual Report for details on our Capital Allocation Policy reviewed and approved on July 12, 2019.

# 7. Related party transactions

These have been discussed in detail in Note 2.24 to the Standalone financial statements in this Integrated Annual Report.

# 8. Events occurring after Balance Sheet date

There were no significant events that occurred after the Balance Sheet date apart from the ones mentioned in ‘Material changes and commitments affecting financial position between the end of the fiscal and date of the report’ in the Board’s report in this Integrated Annual Report.

# 9. Key financial ratios

In accordance with the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) (Amendment) Regulations, 2018, the Company is required to give details of significant changes (change of 25% or more as compared to the immediately previous financial year) in key sector-specific financial ratios.

Net profit has increased from ₹22,110 crore to ₹24,095 crore on a consolidated basis and from ₹21,235 crore to ₹23,268 crore on a standalone basis. Average net worth has not increased in line with increase in net profit on account of share buyback and dividend.

- Market capitalization to revenue ratio is computed as market capitalization as on March 31st of the respective years by revenue. The movement in this ratio is due to change in share price as at the end of March 2023 and March 2022 and due to buyback of equity shares.
- Price earnings ratio is computed as market share price as on March 31st of the respective years by earnings per share. The movement in this ratio is due to change in share price as at the end of March 2023 and March 2022.
- Cash and investments have decreased due to shareholder payouts on account of buyback and dividend in line with our Capital allocation policy.

# V. Outlook, risks and concerns

This section lists forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these statements as a result of certain factors. Our outlook, risks and concerns are as follows:

# I. Risks related to the markets in which we and our clients operate

Spending on technology products and services by our clients and prospective clients fluctuates depending on many factors, including the economic, geo-political, monetary and fiscal policies and regulatory environment in the markets in which they operate.

An economic slowdown or other factors may affect the economic health of the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union (EU), Australia or those industries where our revenues are concentrated.

Our clients may operate in sectors which are adversely impacted by climate change, which could consequently impact our business and reputation.

Restrictions on visas, cost increases in obtaining such visas, increases in required minimum wage levels for visa dependent employees, inordinate delays in obtaining visas due to the pandemic and/or increased enforcement in different countries may affect our ability to compete for, and provide services to clients in work location countries, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our clients may be the subject of economic or other sanctions by governments and regulators in key geographies that we operate in, limiting our ability to grow these relationships, and risking increased penalties and exposure of our business to consequential sanctions.

A large part of our revenues is dependent on a limited number of our clients, and the loss of any one of our major clients could significantly impact our business.

# Ratios where there has been a significant change from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023

Revenue growth, operating margin, net profit margin as well as change in basic EPS have been explained in the relevant sections above.

# The details of return on net worth at standalone and consolidated levels are as follows:

| Particulars             | Standalone | Consolidated | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Return on net worth (%) | 34.0       | 30.2         | 32.0 | 29.1 |      |      |

106 Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-23

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-23

# V. Risks related to our contractual obligations

- Our failure to complete fixed-price and fixed-timeframe contracts, or transaction-based pricing contracts, within budget and on time, may negatively affect our profitability.
- Our client contracts can typically be terminated without cause, which could negatively impact our revenues and profitability.
- Outbreaks of contagious diseases, viruses or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could disrupt our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
- We may not be able to provide end-to-end business solutions for our clients, which could lead to clients discontinuing their work with us, which in turn could harm our business.
- Intense competition in the market for technology services could affect our win rates and pricing, which could reduce our market share and decrease our revenues and profits.
- Our engagements with clients are typically singular in nature and do not necessarily provide for subsequent engagements.
- Our inability to execute contracts and/or amendments with clients on a timely basis can impact our revenues and profits, causing fluctuations in our reported results.

# II. Risks related to the investments we make for our growth

- Our business will suffer if we fail to anticipate and develop new services and enhance existing services in order to keep pace with rapid changes in technology and in the industries on which we focus.
- We may be unable to recoup investment costs incurred in developing our software products and platforms.
- We may engage in acquisitions, strategic investments, strategic partnerships or alliances or other ventures that may or may not be successful.
- Goodwill that we carry on our Balance Sheet could give rise to significant impairment charges in the future.

# III. Risks related to our cost structure

- Our expenses are difficult to predict and can vary significantly from period to period, which could cause fluctuations to our profitability.
- Any inability to manage our growth could disrupt our business, reduce our profitability and adversely impact our ability to implement our growth strategy.
- Wage pressures and the hiring of employees and subcontractors either outside or in India may prevent us from sustaining some of our competitive advantage and may reduce our profits.
- We are investing substantial cash in creating physical and technological infrastructure, and our profitability could be reduced if our business does not grow proportionately.
- Currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates may affect the results of our operations and yield on cash balances.

# IV. Risks related to our employee workforce

- Our success depends largely upon our highly skilled technology professionals and our ability to hire, attract, motivate, retain and train these personnel.
- Our success depends in large part upon our Management team and key personnel and our ability to attract and retain them.

Management’s discussion and analysis

# VI. Internal control systems and their adequacy

The CEO and CFO certification provided in the CEO and CFO Certification section of the Integrated Annual Report discusses the adequacy of our internal control systems and procedures.

# VII. Material developments in human resources / industrial relations, including number of people employed

Our culture and reputation as a leader in consulting, technology, outsourcing and next-generation digital services enable us to attract and retain some of the best talent.

# Human resources management

At Infosys, we believe in amplifying human potential and creating the next opportunity for people, businesses, and communities. For over four decades, we have been a people company that understands the immense potential of technology. As we look to the future, we recognize that the world is changing, and we need to acknowledge our extraordinary potential to be a force for good. Our people are at the center of this vision, and it is our constant endeavor to make Infosys a place where people can be their best selves.

Our purpose is to inspire our people with meaningful work and passionate teams, enabling them to find purpose and make an indelible impact. We believe that talent transformation is an important focus area, and it begins with sensing employee needs and responding with a value proposition that delivers meaning, purpose, and value for them. We are committed to building synergy between how we differentiate ourselves as a company and deliver on the expectations of our employees.

# Return to office and hybrid model of work

It has been over two years since we at Infosys transitioned to hybrid work, prioritizing safety and flexibility. This shift has enabled us to be more responsive to customer demands, more resilient to disruptions, and more productive in our work, characterized by empathy and flexibility.

Today, our offices have integrated technology into their design to deliver an experience far beyond the traditional way of working. At Infosys, our objective is to build and retain social capital among employees to enhance collaboration and innovation in a hybrid workplace. In addition, working from the office in a hybrid model promotes ideation and self-learning, which fosters self-development. Our approach to returning to work has been balanced, with a focus on flexibility, employee safety and well-being, and client commitments.

Distinct-phased approach adopted in transitioning to hybrid work culture

We adopted a multi-pronged approach to enable the transformational hybrid work model – under three the pillars of work, workspace and workforce. The remote-to-hybrid transition was facilitated centrally as well as at the individual unit and Development Center (DC) levels. Transition was enabled at the geo level aligning to the regional norms and policies of individual countries.

Corporate governance report

# The Board

The Board recognizes its primary role of trusteeship of shareholder capital. As a trustee, it strives to ensure excellence and integrity in setting world-class corporate governance standards.

# Corporate governance guidelines

Strong corporate governance is the bedrock of our sustained performance and has helped us gain the trust and respect of all our stakeholders. The enhancement of these corporate governance standards, through periodic evaluation and change, is one of the most important aspects of ensuring value creation for our stakeholders.

Our corporate governance follows the guidelines established by the Board of the Company. These guidelines provide a structure within which directors and the Management can effectively pursue the Company’s objectives for the benefit of its stakeholders. These are framed in conjunction with the Company’s Memorandum &#x26; Articles of Association, the charters of the committees of the Board and applicable laws / regulations / guidelines in force in India, the US and other jurisdictions, as applicable. The guidelines can be accessed on our website, at Corporate Governance Guidelines.

# Independent directors

The Companies Act, 2013 and the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“the Listing Regulations”) as amended, define an ‘independent director’ as a person who, including his / her relatives, is or was not a promoter or employee or key managerial personnel of the company or its subsidiaries. Further, the person and his / her relatives should not have a material pecuniary relationship or transactions with the company or its subsidiaries, during the three immediate preceding financial years or during the current financial year, apart from receiving remuneration as an independent director.

We abide by these definitions of an independent director, in addition to the definitions of an independent director as laid down in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listed company manual, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and US securities laws by virtue of our listing on the NYSE in the US. Based on the disclosures received from all independent directors and in the opinion of the Board, the independent directors fulfill the conditions specified in the Companies Act, 2013, the Listing Regulations, NYSE listing manual and are independent of the Management.

# Role of the Board of Directors

The primary role of the Board is that of trusteeship – to protect and enhance shareholder value. As trustees, the Board has a fiduciary responsibility to ensure that the Company has clear goals aligned to shareholder value and its growth. Further, the Board is also responsible for:

- Exercising appropriate control to ensure that the Company is managed efficiently to fulfill stakeholders’ aspirations and societal expectations.
- Monitoring the effectiveness of the Company’s governance practices and making changes as necessary.
- Providing strategic guidance to the Company and ensuring effective monitoring of the Management.
- Exercising independent judgment on corporate affairs.
- Assigning a sufficient number of non-executive members of the Board to tasks where there is a potential for conflict of interest, to exercise independent judgment.
- Reviewing and guiding corporate strategy, major plans of action, risk policy, annual budgets and business plans, setting performance objectives, monitoring implementation and corporate performance, and overseeing major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestments.

# Meeting of independent directors

For the Board to exercise free and fair judgment in all matters related to the functioning of the Company as well as the Board, it is important for the independent directors to have meetings without the presence of the executive management. Schedule IV of the Companies Act, 2013 and the Rules thereunder mandate that the independent directors of the Company shall hold at least one meeting in a financial year, without the attendance of non-independent directors and members of the Management. Even before the Companies Act, 2013 came into effect, our Board’s process mandated periodic meetings attended exclusively by the independent directors.

# Tenure analysis of the Board as on March 31, 2023

# Board meetings

The tentative dates of Board meetings for the next fiscal are decided in advance and published in the Integrated Annual Report.

# Leading by example

# Responsibilities of the Board

We believe that an active, well-informed, diversified and independent board is necessary to ensure the highest standards of corporate governance. At Infosys, the Board is at the core of our corporate governance practice. The Board oversees the Management’s functions and protects the long-term interests of our stakeholders.

The responsibilities and authority of the Chairman, the CEO &#x26; MD and the lead independent director are as follows:

# Chairman

The Company has separated the roles of Chairman and the CEO &#x26; MD to create a more balanced governance structure. The Chairman leads the Board, and is responsible for fostering and promoting the integrity of the Board while nurturing a culture in which the Board works harmoniously for the long-term benefit of the Company and all its stakeholders. He presides over all meetings of the Board and of the shareholders of the Company. The Chairman takes a lead role in managing the Board and facilitates effective communication among directors. He is responsible for overseeing matters pertaining to governance, including the organization, composition and effectiveness of the Board and its committees, and the performance of individual directors.

The Chairman actively works with the Nomination and Remuneration Committee to plan the composition of the Board and Board committees, induct directors to the Board, plan for director succession, participate effectively in the Board evaluation process and meet with individual directors to provide constructive feedback and advice.

# CEO &#x26; MD

The CEO &#x26; MD is responsible for executing corporate strategy in consultation with the Board, as well as for brand equity, planning, building external contacts and all matters related to the management of the Company. He is responsible for achieving annual and long-term business targets. The CEO &#x26; MD also monitors the external and internal competitive landscape, and new industry developments and standards, identifies opportunities for expansion and acquisition, and builds relationships with customers and markets to enhance shareholder value and implementing the organization’s vision, mission, and overall direction.

The CEO &#x26; MD acts as a link between the Board and the Management and is also responsible for leading and evaluating the work of other executive leaders.

# Lead Independent Director

The lead independent director was appointed by the Board to ensure robust independent leadership of the Board. The general authority and responsibilities of the lead independent director are decided by the group of independent directors. The lead independent director also performs additional duties as determined by the Board.

The lead independent director provides leadership to the independent directors, liaises on behalf of the independent directors and ensures the Board’s effectiveness in maintaining high-quality governance of the organization and effective functioning of the Board.

Corporate governance report

# Selection and appointment of new directors

The Board delegates the screening and selection process to the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, which consists exclusively of independent directors. The Committee, based on defined criteria, as laid out in the Nomination and Remuneration Policy, presents a diverse slate of recommendations of eligible candidates to the Board. The Board recommends the appointment of the director to the shareholders. The proposal is placed before the shareholders for approval.

# Succession planning

The Nomination and Remuneration Committee works with the Board on the leadership succession plan to ensure orderly succession in appointments to the Board and to senior management positions. The Company strives to maintain an appropriate balance of skills and experience within the organization and the Board in an endeavour to introduce new perspectives while maintaining experience and continuity. In addition, promoting senior management within the organization fuels the ambitions of the talent force to earn future leadership roles.

# Training of Board members

All new non-executive directors inducted to the Board are introduced to our Company culture through orientation sessions. Executive directors and senior management provide an overview of operations, and familiarize the new non-executive directors on matters related to our values and commitments. They are also introduced to the organization structure, services, Group structure and subsidiaries, constitution, Board procedures, matters reserved for the Board, major risks and risk management strategy. The details of the familiarization program are also available on the Company’s website, at training-board-members2023.pdf.

We also facilitate the continual educational requirements of our directors. Each director is entitled to a training fee of US$ 5,000 per year. Support is provided for independent directors if they choose to attend educational programs in the areas of Board / corporate governance. Non-executive and independent directors of the Board are familiarized through engagements such as:

# Strategy retreat

As part of our annual strategy planning process, we organize a management strategy retreat with the Board to deliberate on various topics related to strategic planning, progress of ongoing strategic initiatives, risks to strategy execution and the need for new strategic programs to achieve the Company’s long-term objectives. This serves the dual purpose of providing the Board members a platform to bring their expertise to various strategic initiatives, while also providing an opportunity for them to understand detailed aspects of execution and challenges relating to the specific theme. In summary, through this process, members of the Board get a comprehensive and balanced perspective on the strategic issues facing the Company, the competitive differentiation being pursued by the Company, and an overview of the execution plan. In addition, this event allows the members of the Board to interact closely with the senior leadership of the Company.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-23

Corporate governance report

Two of the core values of our C-LIFE, Fairness and excellence are evident in the workings of the Board, its evaluation and the compensation paid to the directors and the executive leadership.

# Board member evaluation

One of the key functions of the Board is to monitor and review the Board evaluation framework. The Board works with the Nomination and Remuneration Committee to lay down the evaluation criteria for the performance of the Chairman, the Board, Board committees, and executive / non-executive / independent directors through peer evaluation, excluding the director being evaluated.

Independent directors have three key roles – governance, control and guidance. Some performance indicators, based on which the independent directors are evaluated, include:

- The ability to contribute to and monitor our corporate governance practices
- The ability to contribute by introducing international best practices to address business challenges and risks
- Active participation in long-term strategic planning
- Commitment to the fulfillment of a director’s obligations and fiduciary responsibilities; these include participation in Board and committee meetings.

To improve the effectiveness of the Board and its committees, as well as that of each individual director, a formal and rigorous Board review is internally undertaken on an annual basis. The Board had engaged Egon Zehnder, a leadership advisory firm on board matters, to conduct the Board evaluation for fiscal 2023. The evaluation process focused on Board dynamics, softer aspects, committee effectiveness and information flow to the Board or its committees, among other matters. The methodology included various techniques such as questionnaires, one-on-one discussions, etc. The recommendations were discussed with the Board and individual feedback was provided. Progress on recommendations from last year and the current year’s recommendations were discussed. The aspects of succession planning and committee composition were also considered. The Board evaluation process was completed during fiscal 2023.

Further, the evaluation process was based on the affirmation received from the independent directors that they met the independence criteria as required under the Companies Act 2013, the Listing Regulations and the NYSE listing manual.

# Executive leadership compensation

Our executive compensation programs encourage reward for performance. A significant portion of the executives’ total rewards is tied to the delivery of long-term corporate performance goals to align with the interest of the shareholders.

As required under the Listing Regulations, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee recommends to the Board the payment of remuneration to the senior management. The Nomination and Remuneration Policy of the Company is available on our website, at https://www.infosys.com/investors/corporate-governance/documents/nomination-remuneration-policy.pdf.

# Non-executive and non-independent chairman’s compensation

Nandan M. Nilekani, Chairman, voluntarily chose not to receive any remuneration for his services rendered to the Company.

# Independent directors’ compensation

The compensation payable to the independent directors is limited to a fixed amount per year as determined and approved by the Board, the sum of which does not exceed 1% of net profit for the year, calculated as per the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013. The Board reviews the performance of independent directors on an annual basis.

The Board, while deciding the basis for determining the compensation of the independent directors, takes various things into consideration. These include global board compensation benchmarking, participation of individual directors in Board and committee meetings, other responsibilities, such as membership or chairmanship of committees, time spent in carrying out other duties, roles and functions as prescribed in Schedule IV of the Act, Listing Regulations and such other factors as the Board deems fit.

140 Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-23


# Shareholders at the 34ᵗʰ AGM held on June 22, 2015 approved

a sum not exceeding 1% of the net profit of the Company per annum, calculated in accordance with the provisions of Section 198 of the Companies Act, 2013, to be paid and distributed among some or all of the non-executive directors of the Company in a manner decided by the Board. This payment will be made with respect to the profits of the Company for each year. The amount payable to independent directors for the year ended March 31, 2023 is `15.17 crore. Additionally, independent directors are also reimbursed for expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties.

(1) The Company normally has five regular Board meetings in a year. Independent directors are expected to attend at least four quarterly Board meetings and the AGM.

(2) For directors based overseas, the travel fee shown is per Board meeting. This is based on the fact that additional travel time of two days will have to be accommodated for independent directors to attend Board meetings in India.

(3) For directors based overseas, incidental fees shown is per Board meeting. This fee is paid to independent directors for expenses incurred during their travel to attend Board meetings in India.

(4) The payment is subject to deduction of tax at source (TDS) as required by applicable tax laws. If any tax is deducted at source as per applicable tax laws, a certificate as prescribed by law will be issued for the amount of tax withheld. The Company shall seek necessary and relevant tax documents as per applicable law in seeking waiver or reducing any applicable withholding taxes.

# Integrity and transparency

# Relationship with stakeholders

Our Company upholds integrity and transparency in all transactions and communications to stakeholders. Our stakeholders are our partners in the path to sustained value creation and therefore, our relationship with stakeholders and clear communication with them is at the center of all disclosures and reports.

# Corporate

Infosys was incorporated in Pune, in 1981, as Infosys Consultants Private Limited, a private limited company under the Companies Act, 1956. In 1983, the corporate headquarters were relocated to Bengaluru. The name of the Company was changed to Infosys Technologies Private Limited in April 1992 and to Infosys Technologies Limited in June 1992, when the Company became a public limited company. We made an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in February 1993 and were listed on stock exchanges in India in June 1993. Trading opened at ₹145 per share, compared to the IPO price of ₹95 per share. In October 1994, we made a private placement of 5,50,000 shares at ₹ 450 each to Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), Financial Institutions (FIs) and body corporates.

In March 1999, we issued 20,70,000 American Depositary Shares (ADSs) (equivalent to 10,35,000 equity shares of par value ₹10 each) at US$ 34 per ADS under the ADS Program, and these ADSs were listed on the NASDAQ National Market. The share data mentioned before is unadjusted for stock split and bonus shares. In July 2003, June 2005 and November 2006, we issued secondary-sponsored American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) of US$ 294 million, US$ 1.1 billion and US$ 1.6 billion, respectively. During fiscal 2012, the name of the Company was changed from Infosys Technologies Limited to Infosys Limited to mark the transition from being a technology services provider to a business transformation partner to our clients. During fiscal 2013, we delisted our ADSs from NASDAQ, and listed them in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Euronext London and Euronext Paris. During fiscal 2019, the Company voluntarily delisted from Euronext London and Paris due to low trading volume. Infosys equity shares and ADSs are listed on NSE and BSE in India and in NYSE, respectively, under the symbol “INFY”.

Note: The above graph depicts the increase in the number of Infosys shares as a result of the Company’s bonus issues over the years and a stock split in 2000 in the ratio of 2:1. For example, if the investor / shareholder held one share in 1986 prior to the bonus issue and continued to hold it, he would have 16,384 shares today owing to the bonus share issues and stock split.

# Risk management report

“Risks related to the geo-political changes, uncertainties in the economy, supply chain constraints, talent availability, technology disruption and inflation have impacted businesses across the world during the fiscal year. Our enterprise risk management processes were instrumental in keeping the Company focused on our most important priorities toward all our stakeholders.”

Deepak Bhalla

EVP – Chief Risk Officer

Note: The risk-related information outlined in this section may not be exhaustive. The discussion may contain statements that are forward looking in nature. Our business is subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward looking statements. If any of the risks materializes, our business, financial conditions or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Our business, operating results, financial performance, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. Readers are advised to refer to the detailed discussion of risk factors and related disclosures in our regulatory filings and exercise their own judgment in assessing risks associated with the Company.

Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function enables the achievement of the Company’s strategic objectives by identifying, analyzing, assessing, mitigating, monitoring and governing any risk or potential threat to these objectives. While this is the key driver, our values, culture and commitment to stakeholders – employees; customers; investors; regulatory bodies; partners and the community around us – are the foundation for our ERM framework. The systematic and proactive identification of risks, and mitigation thereof, enables our organization to boost performance with effective and timely decision-making. Strategic decisions are taken after careful consideration of primary risks, secondary risks, consequential risks and residual risks. The ERM function also enables effective resource allocation through structured qualitative and quantitative risk impact assessment and prioritization based on our risk appetite. Our ERM framework also enables the identification of underlying opportunities during risk assessment, which are then further evaluated and actionized by the business. Our ERM framework encompasses all of the Company’s risks – strategy and strategy execution; operational; and legal and compliance risks. Any of these categories can have internal or external dimensions. Hence, appropriate risk indicators are used to identify these risks proactively. We take cognizance of risks faced by our key stakeholders and their cumulative impact while framing our risk responses.

# Strategy and strategy execution

The risks arising out of the choices we have made in defining our strategy and the risks to the successful execution of our strategy are covered in this category. For example, risks inherent to our industry and our competitiveness are analyzed and mitigated through strategic choices of target markets, our market offerings, business model and talent base.

# Operational

The risks affecting our policies, procedures, people and systems, thereby impacting service delivery or operations, or compromising our core values or business practices are covered in this category. For example, risks such as inefficiencies in internal processes, human rights, business activity disruptions due to natural calamities, climate change events, human conflicts, system failures and cybersecurity attacks.

# Legal and compliance

The risks arising out of threats posed to our financial, organizational, or reputational standing resulting from litigations, non-conformance with laws, regulatory or geo-political developments, code of conduct and contractual compliances are covered in this category.

# Integrated Enterprise Risk Management Framework

We have adopted an integrated ERM framework that is implemented across the organization by the risk management office. Our ERM framework is developed by incorporating the best practices based on COSO and ISO 31000 and then tailored to suit our unique business requirements.

# Salient features of our Enterprise Risk Management program

Our ERM program adopts unique methods to identify risks, evaluate potential impact and promote risk awareness across the organization.

# Secondary, consequential and residual risks

Secondary risks are threats that could impede the mitigation of primary risks. Consequential risks are the unintended consequences of primary mitigation, and residual risks are those risks that are left over after mitigation.

# Enterprise Risk Management program

Exposure for same risks are aggregated as it goes up the hierarchy. This provides enterprise-wide view to the leadership. Cumulated risk view is also provided to understand total exposure arising out of all risks at a unit level.

# Process risk frameworks

Process-specific risk frameworks have been developed for decision-making, for example, frameworks for customer risk, vendor risk, contractual liability, contractual weighted-risk and credit risk.

# Intelligent risk analytics – Live Enterprise

Internal and external risk and performance indicators, loss incidents are used real-time to identify, analyze and assess potential issues that could negatively impact strategic goals.

# RΙSC360 : iGRC

RΙSC360 is the Company’s Governance, Risk management and Compliance (GRC) program that combines three lines of defense under one umbrella. This enables risk-based decision-making and auditing. The Company has implemented a technology platform, iGRC, to provide a consolidated view of risks to strategic goals.

# Risk culture

Our risk culture encourages open and upward communication. Coupled with our belief systems and core values, this drives behavior, guides daily activities and decision-making throughout the organization. We encourage sharing of knowledge and best practices, continuous process improvement and a strong commitment to ethics and integrity.

Highlights of fiscal 2023
During fiscal 2023, we extended the adoption of the integrated disruption and innovation; talent availability; cybersecurity; data protection and privacy; ESG; contractual liabilities; and complex and evolving regulatory environment.

| Geo-political, macro-economic or health events                   | • Unfavorable geo-political, economic or health events may result in currency volatility and reduced spend on technology products and services which may adversely impact demand for our offerings which in turn may impact our growth and profitability. • Emerging risk aspect: Geo-political, economic or health events are dynamic in nature and constantly evolving.

| Technology disruption and innovation                             | • Emerging risk: Not having the right framework and approach to identify, invest in, incubate and operationalize new services and offerings that are in line with technology changes, client preferences and market expectations may disrupt our value proposition and reduce our relevance to customers, impacting our revenue and profitability. The speed and nature of technological changes make it difficult to predict the trend. • Impacted capitals: Financial, Human and Intellectual                                                  | • Innovation framework • Investments in research and development • Robust alliance strategy • Consulting and industry / domain knowledge led solutions • Reskilling program for employees into newer technologies and methodologies • Large deal program • Opportunity – Identify, develop and deploy new offerings to customers leveraging next-generation technologies. |

# Cybersecurity risk management

Cyber risks, being one of the key risks, is managed through multi-layered controls with a defense-in-depth approach starting from the thoughtfully-crafted cybersecurity strategy, supplemented by policies, processes and controls (preventive, detective, and corrective). Our strategy is focussed on four areas: transparency and experience; continual improvement and compliance; cyber resilience; and building and maintaining a positive cybersecurity culture within the organization.

A high-level working group, the enterprise Information Security Council (ISC), has been established, which is responsible for governing and overseeing the Information Security Management System (ISMS) at Infosys. ISC focuses on establishing, directing, monitoring, and executing the information security program with representation from various departments and business units at Infosys and reports to the Operational Risk Council highlighting key risks to the executive leadership.

Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report

Infosys has always placed sustainability at the heart of its business approach. Our ability to fulfil and exceed our responsibilities to our stakeholders is a testament to our commitment. We have balanced our business success with unwavering focus on exemplary governance and responsiveness to the needs of the environment and society. As an early proponent of responsible business, we readily embraced our commitment to integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into our operations. In fiscal 2013, we were among the first companies to publish the Business Responsibility Report (BRR).

Infosys has adopted the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) for fiscal 2023 to provide enhanced disclosures of our ESG practices and priorities. The BRSR follows the NGRBC principles on the social, environmental and economic responsibilities of business. Our BRSR includes our responses to questions about our practices and performance on key principles defined by Regulation 34(2)(f) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015, as amended from time to time, which cover topics across the ESG dimensions.

Our HSE Policy enunciates our philosophy and commitment towards the management of key HSE aspects. Our HSEMS is certified to ISO 45001:2018 standard across all India locations in line with our strategy. At overseas locations, we have implemented processes based on legal requirements / internal benchmarks and have also included them in the internal audits cycle. We have established numerous interventions to address occupational health-related topics, including emotional well-being, mental health, ergonomics, safety, lifestyle diseases and more. Well-equipped occupational health centers are available in all our campuses in India. During the year, doctors and physios have helped employees and their dependents through virtual consultations leveraging our telemedicine portal.

We identify occupational health and safety risks proactively, for all existing / new / modified activities, processes, products or services, and regulatory changes including routine and non-routine activities. Risk assessment includes quarterly evaluation of incidents that have occurred. Hazardous condition, if any, are identified and prioritized for elimination and control. Once the identified hierarchy of controls is implemented, the risk assessment is revisited to assess the residual risks. As Infosys is an IT / ITES company, there are no product risks, but there are those related to the provision of services like ergonomics in work and those associated with the operation of utilities and employee commute. Participation and consultation with relevant personnel involved in the activities is ensured during the risk assessments. Risks are also assessed prior to and post the development of new buildings. Experience from previous projects and current operations are also considered. We continually monitor our construction sites where infrastructure is being established.

Infosys is committed to providing a safe and positive work environment. In keeping with this philosophy, the organization has an open-door policy.

# 7. Mechanism to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases

Infosys’ non-retaliation policy is an embodiment of our values and a cornerstone of our Code. Infosys commits to protect the complainant and ensure that they are not retaliated against because of any report that they raise in good faith. Infosys does not tolerate any form of retaliation (whether by a manager, co-worker or otherwise) against an individual because he or she made a good faith report of an integrity concern. This protection also extends to anyone who assists with or cooperates in an investigation or report of an integrity concern or question. We support those who support our values.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-23

# Leadership indicators

# 1. Details of a business process being modified / introduced as a result of addressing human rights grievances / complaints

At Infosys, our commitment to a values-based ethos is embodied in our Code of Conduct and Ethics. We have strengthened our approach to raising awareness of the Code. In 2022, a digital version of the Infosys Code of Conduct and Ethics was launched. It provides user-friendly access to specific topics in an interactive way. It is a unique audio-visual experience and is easy to navigate. The Code can also be accessed via mobile devices. The launch of the digital version of the Code is designed to help every employee understand the behavior we expect, and the principles and values we uphold. We want to continue to build a culture of compliance, where everyone feels they are doing the right thing and prioritizing legal and ethical choices.

The Code of Conduct and Ethics is also explained and outlined during the onboarding programs. #SwipeRightforIntegrity, an annual legal and compliance event, has evolved into a platform to create awareness, engage in meaningful dialogues with all stakeholders, influence behavior and showcase Infosys’ culture. This has advanced the compliance and ethics program and created greater awareness of expected behavior.

# 2. Details of the scope and coverage of any human rights due diligence conducted.

Infosys is committed to providing a safe and positive work environment. In keeping with this philosophy, the organization has an open-door policy. Training on Infosys values and the Code of Conduct and Ethics, in which our stand on human rights is enshrined, is an integral part of the induction program for new employees. Every employee at Infosys is mandated to take the Smart Awareness Quiz (SAQ) every year which contains learning and assessments on the Code and human rights-related topics. Year-round email campaigns on human rights topics serve as a reminder to employees on the expectations of maintaining a respectful workplace for everyone. The organization commissioned a human rights assessment of its India operations in 2022. The findings of the assessment were used to incorporate appropriate changes to the approach as detailed in our response to Question 1 above.

In fiscal 2023, we launched our Responsible Supply Chain and Supplier Diversity Policy and revised our Supplier Code of Conduct. We also launched an exclusive ESG learning portal for our suppliers, which includes topics on human rights. Our supplier ESG assessments include human rights.

# 3. Water withdrawal, consumption and discharge in areas of water stress (in kilolitres):

For each facility / plant located in areas of water stress, provide the following information: (i) Name of the area (ii) Nature of operations (iii) Water withdrawal, consumption and discharge in the following format (ii) Nature of operations

We recognize that we are working in countries which are water-stressed zones. We continue our efforts in water conservation through a combination of technology interventions, rainwater harvesting, recycling and reuse of waste water, communication and employee engagement. We have over the years succeeded in recharging groundwater aquifers through the deep injection wells and lakes we have created and this has benefitted local communities as well.

# 7. Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words / web link

Infosys has a highly resilient Business Continuity Management System (BCMS) called Phoenix which is certified ISO 22301:2019 Security and Resilience — Business Continuity Management Standard. This program ensures seamless continuity of business and utmost safety of employees and organization assets, while continuously meeting client expectations and helping Infosys to be seen as a leader.

The BCMS program provides a robust framework for planning, establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and continually improving business continuity measures across Infosys and its subsidiaries as per the global BCMS strategy.

Comprehensive business continuity plans are created at three levels covering the business functions, locations and accounts. Integrated into our Enterprise Risk Management Framework, the BCMS plans guide our typical response to events, such as catastrophes, natural or human-made disasters, which could disrupt or severely constrain our operations.

This covers various crisis scenarios as part of detailed risk assessments for functions, locations and accounts which are documented with mitigation plans along with controls put in place. This has ensured a highly resilient management system that has been continuously validated through tests and exercises, and various incidents, which have been successfully tackled without any major business continuity or employee safety impacts. The best example of this has been the unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic in the last two years.

An efficient business continuity management policy has enabled us to maintain the status quo during disasters and pandemics as quickly and as cost-effectively as possible. It has also helped to minimize downtime and achieve sustainable improvements in business continuity and regulatory compliance. For certification, refer to https://www.infosys.com/about/esg/certifications.html.

# 8. Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard.

None.

# 9. Percentage of value chain partners (by value of business done with such partners) that were assessed for environmental impacts.

In fiscal 2022, we undertook a commitment to assess 100 of our top suppliers on ESG over a four-year period. We have covered 46% suppliers as on March 31, 2023.

- Assurance requirements of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) International Standard on
- Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information- (ISAE 3000- revised), for the select environmental and social disclosures in the Report.
- Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements (ISAE 3410), for the GHG emissions data.

Under these standards, we have reviewed the information presented in the Report against the characteristics of relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality, and understandability.

Limited assurance consists primarily of enquiries and analytical procedures. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but it is not a guarantee that it will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

A reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 (revised) and ISAE 3410 involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the quantification of emissions and related information in ‘the Report’.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“SA”s) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone financial statements.

# Key Audit Matter

| Sr. No. | Key Audit Matter    |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| 1       | Revenue recognition |

The Company’s contracts with customers include contracts with multiple products and services. The Company derives revenues from IT services comprising software development and related services, maintenance, consulting and package implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Company’s core and digital offerings and business process management services. The Company assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables involves significant judgement.

In certain integrated services arrangements, contracts with customers include subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Company is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Company first evaluates whether it controls the products or service before it is transferred to the customer. The Company considers whether it has the primary obligation to fulfil the contract, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the products or service and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.

Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on (1) a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Company’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.

As certain contracts with customers involve management’s judgment in (1) identifying distinct performance obligations, (2) determining whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition from these judgments were identified as a key audit matter and required a higher extent of audit effort. Refer Notes 1.4 and 2.18 to the standalone financial statements.

# Auditor’s Response

# Principal Audit Procedures Performed

Our audit procedures related to the (1) identification of distinct performance obligations, (2) determination of whether the Company is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method included the following, among others:

- We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the (a) identification of distinct performance obligations, (b) determination of whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (c) determination of whether fixed price maintenance revenue for certain contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method.
- We selected a sample of contracts with customers and performed the following procedures:
- Obtained and read contract documents for each selection, including master service agreements, and other documents that were part of the agreement.
- Identified significant terms and deliverables in the contract to assess management’s conclusions regarding the (i) identification of distinct performance obligations (ii) whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (iii) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method.

# 2. Key Audit Matter

# Revenue recognition - Fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method

Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either (1) on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from services rendered to the customer and the Company’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.

Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Company to determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.

We identified the estimate of total efforts or costs to complete fixed price contracts measured using the percentage of completion method as a key audit matter as the estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. This estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts or costs incurred to-date and estimates of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations over the term of the contracts.

This required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence and a higher extent of audit effort to evaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts.

Refer Notes 1.4 and 2.18 to the standalone financial statements.

# Auditor’s Response

# Principal Audit Procedures Performed

Our audit procedures related to estimates of total expected costs or efforts to complete for fixed-price contracts included the following, among others:

- We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to (1) recording of efforts or costs incurred and estimation of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations and (2) access and application controls pertaining to time recording, allocation and budgeting systems which prevents unauthorised changes to recording of efforts incurred.
- We selected a sample of fixed price contracts with customers measured using the percentage-of-completion method and performed the following:

Standalone Financial Statements

# Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board’s Report including Annexures to Board’s Report, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, Corporate Governance and Shareholder’s Information, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, standalone financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, including other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-23

Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the standalone financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the standalone financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) Planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the standalone financial statements.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

1. We have sought and obtained all the information and explanations which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary for the purposes of our audit.

We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements of INFOSYS LIMITED (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2023 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.

# Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.

# Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements.

# Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to standalone financial statements

A company's internal financial control with reference to standalone financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to standalone financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

# Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to standalone financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

# xvi.

On the basis of the financial ratios, ageing and expected dates of realisation of financial assets and payment of financial liabilities, other information accompanying the financial statements and our knowledge of the Board of Directors and Management plans and based on our examination of the evidence supporting the assumptions, nothing has come to our attention, which causes us to believe that any material uncertainty exists as on the date of the audit report indicating that Company is not capable of meeting its liabilities existing at the date of balance sheet as and when they fall due within a period of one year from the balance sheet date. We, however, state that this is not an assurance as to the future viability of the Company. We further state that our reporting is based on the facts up to the date of the audit report and we neither give any guarantee nor any assurance that all liabilities falling due within a period of one year from the balance sheet date, will get discharged by the Company as and when they fall due.

# xx.

Accordingly, reporting under clause 3(xx)(a) of the Order is not applicable for the year.

(b) In respect of ongoing projects, the Company has transferred unspent CSR amount as at the end of the previous financial year, to a Special account within a period of 30 days from the end of the said financial year in compliance with the provision of section 135(6) of the Companies Act, 2013. In respect of ongoing projects, the Company has not transferred the unspent CSR amount as at the Balance Sheet date out of the amounts that was required to be spent during the year, to a Special Account in compliance with the provision of sub-section (6) of section 135 of the said Act till the date of our report since the time period for such transfer i.e. 30 days from the end of the financial year has not elapsed till the date of our report.

# Accounting policy

Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit for the year is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments, and item of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated. The Company considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash to be cash equivalents.

The Standalone financial statements are approved for issue by the Company's Board of Directors on April 13, 2023.

# 1.1 Company overview

# 1.2 Basis of preparation of financial statements

These Standalone financial statements are prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS), under the historical cost convention on accrual basis, except for certain financial instruments which are measured at fair values, the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (''the Act'') and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The Ind AS are prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and relevant amendment rules issued thereafter.

Accounting policies have been consistently applied, except where a newly-issued accounting standard is initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in the accounting policy hitherto in use. As the year-end figures are taken from the source and rounded to the nearest digits, the figures reported for the previous quarters might not always add up to the year-end figures reported in this statement.

# 1.3 Use of estimates and judgments

The preparation of the Standalone financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and assumptions affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Standalone financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. The application of accounting policies that require critical accounting estimates, which involve complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions in these financial statements, have been disclosed.

Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information.

Contracts with customers include subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Company is the principal for the transaction.

# 1.4 Critical accounting estimates and judgments

# a. Revenue recognition

The Company’s contracts with customers include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Revenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition and measurement when the contract has been approved, in writing, by the parties to the contract, the parties to contract are committed to perform their respective obligations under the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. The Company assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables, and allocation of transaction price to these distinct performance obligations involves significant judgment.

Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period. Revenue from fixed-price maintenance contract is recognized ratably using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Company's costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of the contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.

The Company uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for other fixed-price contracts. Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Company to determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred.

evaluates whether it controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer. The Company considers whether it has the primary obligation to fulfil the contract, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the goods or service and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable, based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.

# b. Income taxes

The Company's two major tax jurisdictions are India and the United States, though the Company also files tax returns in other overseas jurisdictions. Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid / recovered for uncertain tax positions. In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, Management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, the Management believes that the Company will realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced (Refer to Note 2.17).

rather than their significant accounting policies. The effective date for adoption of this amendment is annual periods beginning on or after April 1, 2023. The Company has evaluated the amendment and the impact of the amendment is insignificant in the standalone financial statements.

Ind AS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors – This amendment has introduced a definition of ‘accounting estimates’ and included amendments to Ind AS 8 to help entities distinguish changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates. The effective date for adoption of this amendment is annual periods beginning on or after April 1, 2023. The Company has evaluated the amendment and there is no impact on its Standalone financial statements.

Ind AS 12, Income Taxes – This amendment has narrowed the scope of the initial recognition exemption so that it does not apply to transactions that give rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences. The effective date for adoption of this amendment is annual periods beginning on or after April 1, 2023. The Company has evaluated the amendment and there is no impact on its Standalone financial statements.

# 2. Notes to the Standalone financial statements

# 2.1 Property, plant and equipment

# Accounting policy

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Costs directly attributable to acquisition are capitalized until the property, plant and equipment are ready for use, as intended by the Management. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived at after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The Company depreciates property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows :

| c. Property, plant and equipment                                   | Buildings (1)              | 22-25 years                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Property, plant and equipment represent a significant proportion   | Plant and machinery (1)(2) | 5 years                                         |
| of the asset base of the Company. The charge in respect of         | Office equipment           | 5 years                                         |
| periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate     | Computer equipment (1)     | 3-5 years                                       |
| of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected residual       | Furniture and fixtures (1) | 5 years                                         |
| value at the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values | Vehicles (1)               | 5 years                                         |
| of the Company's assets are determined by the Management           | Leasehold improvements     | Lower of useful life of the asset or lease term |

(1) Based on technical evaluation, the Management believes that the useful lives, as given above, best represent the period over which the Management expects to use these assets. Hence, the useful lives for these assets is different from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013.

(2) Includes solar plant with a useful life of 25 years. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The useful lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology.

# Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment

Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet date is classified as capital advances under other non-current assets. The cost of assets not ready to use before such date are disclosed under ‘Capital work-in-progress’. Subsequent expenditures relating to property, plant and equipment is capitalized only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with these will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the financial statements upon sale or retirement of the asset.

on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. An impairment loss is reversed in the Statement of Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of any accumulated depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.

# Impairment

Property, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined.

# 2.2.2 Other intangible assets

Accounting policy

Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Intangible assets are amortized over their respective individual estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset is based on a number of factors, including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, and known technological advances), and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end.

Research costs are expensed as incurred. Software product development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and commercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, the future economic benefits are probable, the Company has an intention and ability to complete and use or sell the software, and the costs can be measured reliably. The costs which can be capitalized include the cost of material, direct labor, and overhead costs that are directly attributable to prepare the asset for its intended use.

The changes in the carrying value of acquired intangible assets for the year ended March 31, 2023 are as follows:

# 2.3 Leases

# Accounting Policy

The Company as a lessee

The Company’s lease asset classes consist of leases for land, buildings and computers. The Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (i) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.

At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

As a lessee, the Company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. The Company makes an assessment on the expected lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Company considers factors such as any significant leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of the lease and the importance of the underlying asset to Infosys’s operations taking into account the location of the underlying asset and the availability of suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current economic circumstances.

Certain lease arrangements include the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.

The ROU assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

ROU assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. Right-of-use-assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

236 Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-23

The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset if the Company changes its assessment to whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash flows.

# The Company as a lessor

Leases for which the Company is a lessor is classified as a finance or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

When the Company is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease. For operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

# 2.11 Financial instruments

risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures.

# Accounting policy

The counterparty for such contracts is generally a bank.

# 2.11.1 Initial recognition

(i) Financial assets or financial liabilities, carried at fair value through profit or loss.

The Company recognizes financial assets and financial liabilities when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities, which are not at fair value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial recognition. Regular way purchase and sale of financial assets are accounted for at trade date.

# 2.11.2 Subsequent measurement

# a. Non-derivative financial instruments

(i) Financial assets carried at amortized cost

A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortized cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

(ii) Financial assets carried at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

A financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The Company has made an irrevocable election for its investments which are classified as equity instruments to present the subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income based on its business model.

(iii) Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss

A financial asset, which is not categorized in any of the above categories, is subsequently fair valued through profit or loss.

(iv) Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method, except for contingent consideration recognized in a business combination, which is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. For trade and other payables maturing within one year from the Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

(v) Investment in subsidiaries

Investment in subsidiaries is carried at cost in the separate financial statements.

# b. Derivative financial instruments

The Company holds derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts, to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange exposure. Derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized initially at fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognized in net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss when incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, these derivatives are measured at fair value through profit or loss and the resulting exchange gains or losses are included in other income. Assets / liabilities in this category are presented as current assets / current liabilities if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realized within 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.

(ii) Cash flow hedge

The Company designates certain foreign exchange forward and options contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecasted cash transactions. When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized immediately in the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognized in cash flow hedge reserve, till the period the hedge was effective, remains in cash flow hedge reserve until the forecasted transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve is transferred to the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss upon the occurrence of the related forecasted transaction. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in cash flow hedge reserve is reclassified to net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

# 2.11.3 Derecognition of financial instruments

The Company derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109. A financial liability (or a part of a financial liability) is derecognized from the Company's Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.

# 2.11.4 Fair value of financial instruments

In determining the fair value of its financial instruments, the Company uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each reporting date. The methods used to determine fair value include discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing model, market multiples, available quoted market prices and dealer quotes. All methods of assessing fair value result in general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized.

Refer to table 'Financial instruments by category' below for the disclosure on carrying value and fair value of financial assets and liabilities. For financial assets and liabilities maturing within one year from the Balance Sheet date and which are not carried at fair value, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

# 2.11.5 Impairment

The Company recognizes loss allowances using the expected credit loss (ECL) model for the financial assets and unbilled revenues which are not fair valued through profit or loss. Loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues with no significant financing component is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition, in which case those are measured at lifetime ECL.

The Company determines the allowance for credit losses based on historical loss experience adjusted to reflect current and estimated future economic conditions. The Company considers current and anticipated future economic conditions relating to industries the Company deals with and the countries where it operates. The amount of ECLs (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date to the amount that is required to be recorded is recognized as an impairment loss or gain in Statement of Profit and Loss.

Standalone Financial Statements

For trade receivables, trade payables and other assets and payables maturing within one year from the Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate the fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

# Fair value hierarchy

- Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3 – Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

# The fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as at March 31, 2023 is as follows :

# Financial Risk Management

# Financial Risk Factors

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks–market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's primary focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimize potential adverse effects on its financial performance. The primary market risk to the Company is foreign exchange risk. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate foreign exchange related risk exposures.

The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its sales and services in the United States and elsewhere, and purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. The Company holds derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The exchange rate between the Indian Rupee and foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the results of the Company’s operations are adversely affected as the Rupee appreciates / depreciates against these currencies.

During the year ended March 31, 2022, tax-free bonds of ₹576 crore were transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 of fair value hierarchy since these were valued based on quoted price. Further, tax-free bonds, non-convertible debentures and government securities of ₹890 crore were transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 of fair value hierarchy, since these were valued based on market observable inputs. A one percentage point change in the unobservable inputs, used in fair valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities, does not have a significant impact in its value.

During the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, the Company has designated certain foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecasted cash transactions. The related hedge transactions for balance in cash flow hedge reserve as at March 31, 2023 are expected to occur and reclassified to Statement of Profit and Loss within three months.

The Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of its forecasted cash flows. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument.

The reconciliation of cash flow hedge reserve for the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 is as follows:

# Credit risk

Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by the counterparty resulting in a financial loss. The maximum exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily from trade receivables amounting to ₹20,773 crore and ₹18,966 crore as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively and unbilled revenue amounting to ₹12,384 crore and ₹9,279 crore as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively. Trade receivables and unbilled revenue are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue from customers majorly located in the US and Europe. Credit risk has always been managed by the Company through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of the customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company uses the expected credit loss model to assess any required allowances; and uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues. This matrix takes into account credit reports and other related credit information to the extent available.

The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristic of each customer and the concentration of risk from the top few customers. Exposure to customers is diversified and there is no single customer contributing more than 10% of outstanding trade receivables and unbilled revenues.

The details in respect of percentage of revenues generated from top five customers and top ten customers are as follows:

| Particulars                     | Year ended March 31 | 2023 | 2022 |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---- | ---- |
| Revenue from top five customers | (In %)              | 11.3 | 11.9 |
| Revenue from top ten customers  | (In %)              | 19.6 | 20.5 |

Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited as the Company generally invests in deposits with banks and financial institutions with high ratings, assigned by international and domestic credit rating agencies. Ratings are monitored periodically and the Company has considered the latest available credit ratings as at the date of approval of these financial statements.

Majority of investments of the Company are fair valued based on Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. These investments primarily include investment in liquid mutual fund units, target maturity fund units, tax free bonds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, treasury bills, government securities, quoted bonds issued by government and quasi-government organizations and non-convertible debentures. The Company invests after considering counterparty risks based on multiple criteria including Tier I capital, Capital Adequacy Ratio, Credit Rating, Profitability, NPA levels and deposit base of banks and financial institutions. These risks are monitored regularly as per Company's risk management program.

# Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time. The Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and the cash flow that is generated from operations. The Company has no outstanding borrowings. The Company believes that the working capital is sufficient to meet its current requirements.

(In %) As at March 31, 2023, the Company had a working capital of ₹24,640 crore including cash and cash equivalents of ₹6,534 crore and current investments of ₹4,476 crore. As at March 31, 2022, the Company had a working capital of ₹27,461 crore including cash and cash equivalents of ₹12,270 crore and current investments of ₹5,467 crore.

As at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, the outstanding compensated absences were ₹1,969 crore and ₹1,850 crore, respectively, which have been substantially funded. Accordingly, no liquidity risk is perceived.

The allowance for lifetime expected credit loss on customer balances recognized for the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 is ₹139 crore and ₹93 crore, respectively. The movement in credit loss allowance on customer balance is as follows:

As at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, 2,24,924 and 2,65,561 cash settled options were outstanding, respectively. The carrying value of liability towards cash-settled share-based payments was ₹4 crore and ₹13 crore as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 respectively.

The fair value of the awards are estimated using the Black-Scholes Model for time and non-market performance-based options, and Monte Carlo simulation model is used for TSR-based options. The inputs to the model include the share price at date of grant, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends, expected term and the risk-free rate of interest. Expected volatility during the expected term of the options is based on historical volatility of the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the options. Expected volatility of the comparative company have been modelled based on historical movements in the market prices of their publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the options. Correlation coefficient is calculated between each peer entity and the indices as a whole or between each entity in the peer group.

# The fair value of each equity settled award is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:

# 2.16 Provisions

# Accounting policy

A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that is reasonably estimable, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.

# a. Post-sales client support

The Company provides its clients with a fixed-period post-sales support on its fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts. Costs associated with such support services are accrued at the time related revenues are recorded in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The Company estimates such costs based on historical experience and estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis for any material changes in assumptions and likelihood of occurrence.

# b. Onerous contracts

Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations under the contract. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognizes any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

# 2.17 Income taxes

# Accounting policy

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred income tax. Income tax expense is recognized in net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in equity or other comprehensive income. Current income tax for current and prior periods is recognized at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date. These are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

# Changes in Tax Rates on Deferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities

is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment or the substantive enactment date. A deferred income tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilized. Deferred income taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and branches where it is expected that the earnings of the subsidiary or branch will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.

The Company offsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities; deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities; where it has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Tax benefits of deductions earned on exercise of employee share options in excess of compensation charged to income are credited to equity.

# Income Tax Expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss is as follows:

| Particulars        | Year ended March 31, 2023 | Year ended March 31, 2022 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Current taxes      | 8,167                     | 6,960                     |
| Deferred taxes     | 208                       | 300                       |
| Income tax expense | 8,375                     | 7,260                     |

Income tax expense for the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 includes reversal (net of provisions) of ₹116 crore and ₹250 crore, respectively. These reversals pertaining to prior periods are primarily on account of adjudication of certain disputed matters, upon filing of tax return and completion of assessments, across various jurisdictions.

# A reconciliation of the income tax provision to the amount computed by applying the statutory income tax rate to the income before income taxes is as follows:

The applicable Indian corporate statutory tax rate for the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 is 34.94% each. The foreign tax expense is due to income taxes payable overseas, principally in the United States. In India, the Company has benefited from certain income tax incentives that the Government of India had provided for export of software and services from the units registered under the Special Economic Zones Act (SEZs), 2005. SEZ units, which began the provision of services on or after April 1, 2005 are eligible for a deduction of 100% of profits or gains derived from the export of services for the first five years from the financial year in which the unit commenced the provision of services and 50% of such profits or gains for further five years. Up to 50% of such profits or gains is also available for a further five years subject to creation of a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Re-investment Reserve out of the profit for the eligible SEZ units and utilization of such reserve by the Company for acquiring new plant and machinery for the purpose of its business as per the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961.

Deferred income tax for the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 substantially relates to origination and reversal of temporary differences. Infosys is subject to a 15% Branch Profit Tax (BPT) in the US to the extent its US branch's net profit during the year is greater than the increase in the net assets of the US branch during the year, computed in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code. As at March 31, 2023, Infosys' US branch net assets amounted to approximately ₹6,948 crore. As at March 31, 2023, the Company has a deferred tax liability for branch profit tax of ₹148 crore (net of credits), as the Company estimates that these branch profits are expected to be distributed in the foreseeable future.

Deferred income tax liabilities have not been recognized on temporary differences amounting to ₹10,948 crore and ₹9,618 crore as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively, associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches as the Company is able to control the timing of reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The Company majorly intends to repatriate earnings from subsidiaries and branches only to the extent these can be distributed in a tax free manner.

# 2.18 Revenue from operations

# Accounting policy

The Company derives revenues primarily from IT services comprising software development and related services, cloud and infrastructure services, maintenance, consulting and package implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Company’s core and digital offerings (together called as “software related services”). Contracts with customers are either on a time-and-material, unit of work, fixed-price or on a fixed-timeframe basis.

Revenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition and measurement when the contract has been approved in writing, by the parties to the contract, the parties have committed to perform their obligations under the contract and the contract is legally enforceable. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services ('performance obligations') to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company has received or expects to receive in exchange for these products or services ('transaction price'). When there is uncertainty as to collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.

The Company assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item, when sold separately, is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In the absence of such evidence, the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin, under which the Company estimates the cost of satisfying the performance obligation and then adds an appropriate margin based on similar services.



# Standalone Financial Statements

The Company’s contracts may include variable consideration including rebates, volume discounts and penalties. The Company includes variable consideration as part of transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the variable consideration and when it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.

Revenue on time-and-material and unit-of-work-based contracts, are recognized as the related services are performed. Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on a straight-line basis, when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period, or ratably using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and Company’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time, is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method. Efforts or costs expended are used to determine progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. Progress towards completion is measured as the ratio of costs or efforts incurred to date (representing work performed) to the estimated total costs or efforts. Estimates of transaction price and total costs or efforts are continuously monitored over the term of the contracts and are recognized in net profit in the period when these estimates change or when the estimates are revised. Revenues and the estimated total costs or efforts are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts, are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.

The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance-based billing and / or milestone-based progress billings. Revenues in excess of billing are classified as unbilled revenues, while billing in excess of revenues is classified as contract liabilities (which we refer to as "unearned revenues"). In arrangements for software development and related services and maintenance services, the revenue recognition criteria for each distinct performance obligation is applied and the arrangements with customers generally meet this criteria for considering software development and related service as distinct performance obligations. For allocating the transaction price, the Company measures the revenue in respect of each performance obligation of a contract at its relative standalone selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In cases where the Company is unable to determine the standalone selling price, the Company uses the expected cost plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. For software development and related services, the performance obligations are satisfied as and when the services are rendered, since the customer generally obtains control of the work as it progresses.

Certain cloud and infrastructure services contracts include multiple elements which may be subject to other specific accounting guidance, such as leasing guidance. These contracts are accounted in accordance with such specific accounting guidance. In such arrangements where the Company is able to determine that hardware and services are distinct performance obligations, it allocates the consideration to these performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. In the absence of standalone selling price, the Company uses the expected cost-plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. When such arrangements are considered as a single performance obligation, revenue is recognized over the period and measure of progress is determined based on promise in the contract.

Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a “right to use” the licenses is recognized at the time the license is made available to the customer. Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a “right to access” is recognized over the access period.

Arrangements to deliver software products generally have three elements: license, implementation and Annual Technical Services (ATS). When implementation services are provided in conjunction with the licensing arrangement, and the license and implementation have been identified as two distinct separate performance obligations, the transaction price for such contracts are allocated to each performance obligation of the contract based on their relative standalone selling prices. In the absence of standalone selling price for implementation, the Company uses the expected cost-plus-margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. Where the license is required to be substantially customized as part of the implementation service, the entire arrangement fee for license and implementation is considered to be a single performance obligation and the revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method while the implementation is performed. Revenue from client training, support and other services arising due to the sale of software products is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied. ATS revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line over the period in which the services are rendered.

Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Company is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Company first evaluates whether it controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer. The Company considers whether it has the primary obligation to fulfil the contract, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the goods or service and, therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.

The incremental costs of obtaining a contract (i.e., costs that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained) are recognized as an asset if the Company expects to recover them.

Certain eligible, non-recurring costs (e.g. set-up or transition or transformation costs) that do not represent a separate performance obligation are recognized as an asset when such costs (a) relate directly to the contract; (b) generate or enhance resources of the Company that will be used in satisfying the performance obligation in the future; and (c) are expected to be recovered.

Capitalized contract costs, relating to upfront payments to customers, are amortized to revenue and other capitalized costs are amortized to expenses over the respective contract life on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods or services to customer to which the asset relates. Capitalized costs are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when the present value of projected remaining operating cash flows is not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the capitalized costs.

The Company presents revenues net of indirect taxes in its Statement of Profit and Loss.

# Digital services

Digital services comprise of service and solution offerings of the Company that enable our clients to transform their businesses. These include offerings that enhance customer experience, leverage AI-based analytics and Big Data, engineer digital products and IoT, modernize legacy technology systems, migrate to cloud applications and implement advanced cyber security systems.

# Core services

Core services comprise traditional offerings of the Company that have scaled and industrialized over a number of years. These primarily include application management services, proprietary application development services, independent validation solutions, product engineering and management, infrastructure management services, traditional enterprise application implementation, support and integration services.

# Products and platforms

The Company derives revenues from the sale of products and platforms including Infosys Applied AI which applies next-generation AI and machine learning.

The percentage of revenue from fixed-price contracts for each of the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 is approximately 55% and 53%, respectively.

# Trade receivables and contract balances

The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in receivables, unbilled revenue, and unearned revenue on the Company’s Balance Sheet. Amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) or upon achievement of contractual milestones.

The Company’s receivables are rights to consideration that are unconditional. Unbilled revenues, comprising revenues in excess of billings from time and material contracts and fixed-price maintenance contracts, are classified as financial asset when the right to consideration is unconditional and is due only after a passage of time.

Invoicing to the clients for other fixed-price contracts is based on milestones as defined in the contract and, therefore, the timing of revenue recognition is different from the timing of invoicing to the customers. Therefore, unbilled revenues for other fixed-price contracts (contract asset) are classified as non-financial asset because the right to consideration depends on completion of contractual milestones.

Invoicing in excess of earnings are classified as 'unearned revenue'. Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of impairment in the Balance Sheet.

During the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, the company recognized revenue of ₹4,391 crore and ₹2,831 crore arising from opening unearned revenue as of April 1, 2022 and April 1, 2021, respectively.

During the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, ₹5,378 crore and ₹3,711 crore of unbilled revenue pertaining to other fixed price and fixed-timeframe contracts as of April 1, 2022 and April 1, 2021, respectively has been reclassified to Trade receivables upon billing to customers on completion of milestones.

# Remaining performance obligation disclosure

The remaining performance obligation disclosure provides the aggregate amount of the transaction price yet to be recognized as at the end of the reporting period, and an explanation as



Standalone Financial Statements

to when the Company expects to recognize these amounts in revenue. Applying the practical expedient as given in Ind AS 115, the Company has not disclosed the remaining performance obligation related disclosures for contracts where the revenue recognized corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity's performance completed to date, typically those contracts where invoicing is on time-and-material and unit of work-based contracts. Remaining performance obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustment for revenue that has not materialized and adjustments for currency fluctuations. The aggregate value of performance obligations that are completely or partially unsatisfied as at March 31, 2023, other than those meeting the exclusion criteria mentioned above, is ₹70,680 crore. Out of this, the Company expects to recognize revenue of around 57.7% within the next one year and the remaining thereafter. The aggregate value of performance obligations that are completely or partially unsatisfied as at March 31, 2022 is ₹65,748 crore. The contracts can generally be terminated by the customers and typically includes an enforceable termination penalty payable by them. Generally, customers have not terminated contracts without cause. Transaction gains or losses realized upon settlement of foreign currency transactions are included in determining net profit for the period in which the transaction is settled. Revenue, expense and cash-flow items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currencies using the exchange rate in effect on the date of the transaction. Other Comprehensive Income, net of taxes includes translation differences on non-monetary financial assets measured at fair value at the reporting date, such as equities classified as financial instruments and measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).

# Government grant

The Company recognizes government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government grants related to assets are treated as deferred income and are recognized in the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a systematic and rational basis over the useful life of the asset. Government grants related to revenue are recognized on a systematic basis in the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs which they intend to compensate.

# 2.21 Employee benefits

# 2.21.1 Gratuity and pensions

The Company provides for gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan ("the Gratuity Plan") covering eligible Indian employees of Infosys. The Gratuity Plan provides a lumpsum payment to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee's salary and the tenure of employment with the Company.

The Company contributes gratuity liabilities to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust ("the Trust"). Trustees administer contributions made to the Trusts and contributions are invested in a scheme with the Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law.

The Company operates defined benefit pension plan in certain overseas jurisdictions, in accordance with the local laws. These plans are managed by third party fund managers. The plans provide for periodic payouts after retirement and / or a lumpsum payment as set out in rules of each fund and includes death and disability benefits. The defined benefit plans require contributions, which are based on a percentage of salary that varies depending on the age of the respective employees.

Liabilities with regard to these defined benefit plans are determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an external actuary, at each Balance Sheet date using the projected unit credit method. These defined benefit plans expose the Company to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest rate risk and market risk.

The Company recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit plan in its Balance Sheet as an asset or liability. Gains and losses through re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability / (asset) are recognized in other comprehensive income and are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. The actual return of the portfolio of plan assets, in excess of the yields computed by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation is recognized in other comprehensive income. The effect of any plan amendments is recognized in net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

# 2.21.2 Provident fund

Eligible employees of Infosys receive benefits from a provident fund, which is a defined benefit plan. Both the eligible employee and the Company make monthly contributions to the provident fund plan equal to a specified percentage of the covered employee's salary. The Company contributes a portion to the Infosys Limited Employees' Provident Fund Trust. The trust invests in specific designated instruments as permitted by Indian law. The remaining portion is contributed to the government-administered pension fund. The rate at which the annual interest is payable to the beneficiaries by the trust is being administered by the Government. The Company has an obligation to make good the shortfall, if any, between the return from the investments of the Trust and the notified interest rate.

(1) For domestic defined benefit plan in India, the market for high quality corporate bonds being not developed, the yield of government bonds is considered as the discount rate. For most of our overseas defined benefit plan, given that the market for high quality corporate bonds is not developed, the government bond rate adjusted for corporate spreads is used.

(2) The average rate of increase in compensation levels is determined by the Company, considering factors such as, the Company’s past compensation revision trends, inflation in respective markets and Management’s estimate of future salary increases.

(3) Attrition rate considered is the Management’s estimate based on the past long-term trend of employee turnover in the Company. The tenure has been considered taking into account the past long-term trend of employees' average remaining service life which reflects the average estimated term of post-employment benefit obligation.

For domestic defined benefit plan in India, assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set in accordance with the published statistics by the Life Insurance Corporation of India. For overseas defined benefit plan, the assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set with regard to the latest statistics in life expectancy, plan experience and other relevant data. The Company assesses all the above assumptions with its projected long-term plans of growth and prevalent industry standards.

The Company contributes all ascertained liabilities towards gratuity to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust. Trustees administer contributions made to the trust. The plan assets of the overseas defined benefit plan have been primarily invested in insurer managed funds and the asset allocation for plan assets is determined based on the investment criteria prescribed under the relevant regulations applicable to pension funds and the insurer managers. The insurers' investment are well diversified and also provide for guaranteed interest rates arrangements.

Actual return on assets (including remeasurement) of the gratuity plan for the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 were ₹111 crore and ₹105 crore, respectively and for the pension plan were (₹44) crore and ₹53 crore, respectively. The contributions for gratuity are invested in a scheme with the Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law. The details of major plan assets into various categories as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 are as follows:

These defined benefit plans expose the Company to actuarial risk which are set out below :

- Interest rate risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is generally calculated using a discount rate determined with reference to government bond yields and in certain overseas jurisdictions, it is calculated in reference to government bond yield adjusted for a corporate spread. If bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.
- Life expectancy and investment risk: The pension fund offers the choice between a lifelong pension and a cash lumpsum upon retirement. The pension fund has defined rates for converting the lumpsum to a pension and there is the risk that the members live longer than implied by these conversion rates and that the pension assets don’t achieve the investment return implied by these conversion rates.
- Asset volatility: A proportion of the pension fund is held in equities, which is expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term but give exposure to volatility and risk in the short term. The pension fund board of insurer is responsible for the investment strategy and equity allocation is justified given the long-term investment horizon of the pension fund and the objective to provide a reasonable long term return on members’ account balances.

Sensitivity for significant actuarial assumptions is computed by varying one actuarial assumption used for the valuation, keeping all other actuarial assumptions constant. In practice, this is not probable, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. The Company expects to contribute ₹195 crore to gratuity and ₹25 crore to pension during the fiscal 2024.

# Maturity profile of defined benefit obligation is as follows:

| (In ₹ crore) | Particulars   | Gratuity | Pension |
| ------------ | ------------- | -------- | ------- |

# c. Provident fund

Infosys has an obligation to fund any shortfall on the yield of the trust’s investments over the administered interest rates on an annual basis. These administered rates are determined annually, predominantly considering the social rather than economic factors. The actuary has provided a valuation for provident fund liabilities on the basis of guidance issued by Actuarial Society of India.

The asset allocation for plan assets is determined based on the investment criteria prescribed under the relevant regulations. The actuarial valuation of PF liability exposes the Company to interest rate risk. The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a discount rate based on government bonds. If bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.

As at March 31, 2023, the defined benefit obligation would be affected by approximately ₹48 crore and ₹97 crore on account of a 0.25% increase / decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets. The Company contributed ₹1,053 crore and ₹768 crore to the provident fund during the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively. The same has been recognized in the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss under the head, employee benefit expense. The provident plans are applicable only to employees drawing a salary in Indian Rupees.

Accounting policy

Basic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per equity share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. The dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for the proceeds receivable, had the equity shares been actually issued at fair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding equity shares). Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as at the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date. Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently for each period presented.

The number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any share splits and bonus shares issues, for changes effected prior to the approval of the financial statements by the Board. The reconciliation of the equity shares used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per equity share is as follows:

# 2.23 Contingent liabilities and commitments

# Accounting policy

Contingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events, not wholly within the control of the entity, or a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

* Uncalled capital pertaining to investments

(1) As at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, claims against the Company not acknowledged as debts in respect of income tax matters amounted to ₹3,953 crore and ₹3,898 crore, respectively. The claims against the Company primarily represent demands arising on completion of assessment proceedings under the Income-tax Act, 1961. These claims are on account of multiple issues of disallowances, such as disallowance of profits earned from STP Units and SEZ Units, disallowance of deductions in respect of employment of new employees under Section 80JJAA, disallowance of expenditure towards software being held as capital in nature, and payments made to Associated Enterprises held as liable for withholding of taxes. These matters are pending before various Income tax authorities and the Management including its tax advisors expect that its position will likely be upheld on ultimate resolution, and will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations. Amount paid to statutory authorities against the tax claims amounted to ₹6,105 crore and ₹5,607 crore as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively.

(2) Capital contracts primarily comprise commitments for infrastructure facilities and computer equipments.

# Legal proceedings

The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims, which have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company’s management reasonably expects that these legal actions, when ultimately concluded and determined, will not have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

| 1       | Revenue recognition The Group’s contracts with customers include contracts with multiple products and services. The group derives revenues from IT services comprising software development and related services, maintenance, consulting and package implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Group’s core and digital offerings and business process management services. The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables involves significant judgement. In certain integrated services arrangements, contracts with customers include subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first evaluates whether it controls the products or service before it is transferred to the customer. The Group considers whether it has the primary obligation to fulfil the contract, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the products or service and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent. Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on (1) a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables. As certain contracts with customers involve management’s judgment in (1) identifying distinct performance obligations, (2) determining whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition from these judgments were identified as a key audit matter and required a higher extent of audit effort. Refer Notes 1.5 and 2.18 to the consolidated financial statements. Auditor’s Response Principal Audit Procedures Performed Our audit procedures related to the (1) identification of distinct performance obligations, (2) determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the (a) identification of distinct performance obligations, (b) determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (c) determination of whether fixed price maintenance revenue for certain contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method. • We selected a sample of contracts with customers and performed the following procedures: – Obtained and read contract documents for each selection, including master service agreements, and other documents that were part of the agreement. – Identified significant terms and deliverables in the contract to assess management’s conclusions regarding the (i) identification of distinct performance obligations (ii) whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (iii) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method. |

# Key Audit Matter

# 2. Revenue recognition - Fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method

Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either (1) on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.

Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Group to determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.

We identified the estimate of total efforts or costs to complete fixed price contracts measured using the percentage of completion method as a key audit matter as the estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. This estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts or costs incurred to-date and estimates of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations over the term of the contracts.

This required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence and a higher extent of audit effort to evaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts. Refer Notes 1.5 and 2.18 to the consolidated financial statements.

# Auditor’s Response

# Principal Audit Procedures Performed

Our audit procedures related to estimates of total expected costs or efforts to complete for fixed-price contracts included the following, among others:

- We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to (1) recording of efforts or costs incurred and estimation of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations and (2) access and application controls pertaining to time recording, allocation and budgeting systems which prevents unauthorised changes to recording of efforts incurred.
- We selected a sample of fixed price contracts with customers measured the using percentage-of-completion method and performed the following:

The respective Boards of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Company, as aforesaid.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Boards of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for assessing the ability of the respective entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Boards of Directors either intend to liquidate their respective entities or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The respective Boards of Directors of the companies included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company and its subsidiary companies which are companies incorporated in India, has adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the consolidated financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the consolidated financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the consolidated financial statements.

We communicate with those charged with governance of the Company and such other entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements

A company's internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

# Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

# Opinion

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements and such internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2023, based on the criteria for internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements established by the respective companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI.

# Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

# Accounting policy

Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit for the period is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated. The Group considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash to be cash equivalents.

Consolidated Financial Statements

# Overview and notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

# 1. Overview

# 1.1 Company overview

Infosys Limited ("the Company" or Infosys) provides consulting, technology, outsourcing and next-generation digital services, to enable clients to execute strategies for their digital transformation. Infosys' strategic objective is to build a sustainable organization that remains relevant to the agenda of clients, while creating growth opportunities for employees and generating profitable returns for investors. Infosys' strategy is to be a navigator for our clients as they ideate, plan and execute on their journey to a digital future. Infosys together with its subsidiaries and controlled trusts is hereinafter referred to as 'the Group'.

The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in India, and has its registered office at Electronics city, Hosur Road, Bengaluru 560100, Karnataka, India. The Company has its primary listings on the BSE Ltd. and National Stock Exchange of India Limited. The Company’s American Depositary Shares (ADS) representing equity shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The Group's Consolidated financial statements are approved for issue by the Company's Board of Directors on April 13, 2023.

# 1.2 Basis of preparation of financial statements

These Consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS), under the historical cost convention on accrual basis, except for certain financial instruments which are measured at fair values, the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act") and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The Ind AS are prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and relevant amendment rules issued thereafter. Accounting policies have been consistently applied, except where a newly-issued accounting standard is initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in the accounting policy hitherto in use. As the year-end figures are taken from the source and rounded to the nearest digits, the figures reported for the previous quarters might not always add up to the year-end figures reported in this statement.

# 1.3 Basis of consolidation

Infosys consolidates entities which it owns or controls. The Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company, its controlled trusts and its subsidiaries. Control exists when the parent has power over the entity, is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns by using its power over the entity. Power is demonstrated through existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant activities, those which significantly affect the entity's returns. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control commences until the date control ceases.

The financial statements of the Group companies are consolidated on a line-by-line basis and intra-group balances and transactions including unrealized gain / loss from such transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. These financial statements are prepared by applying uniform accounting policies in use at the Group. Non-controlling interests which represent part of the net profit or loss and net assets of subsidiaries that are not, directly or indirectly, owned or controlled by the Company, are excluded.

# 1.4 Use of estimates and judgments

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the Management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and assumptions affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. The application of accounting policies that require critical accounting estimates, which involve complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions in these financial statements, have been disclosed in Note 1.5. Accounting estimates could change from period to period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Appropriate changes in estimates are made as the Management becomes aware of changes in circumstances surrounding the estimates. Changes in estimates and judgments are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which changes are made and, if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the Consolidated financial statements.

# 1.5 Critical accounting estimates and judgments

a. Revenue recognition

The Group’s contracts with customers include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Revenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition and measurement when the contract has been approved, in writing, by the parties to the contract, the parties to contract are committed to perform their respective obligations under the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables, and allocation of transaction price to these distinct performance obligations involves significant judgment. Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period. Revenue from fixed-price maintenance contract is recognized ratably using a percentage-of-completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of the contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive.

# 1.6 Recent accounting pronouncements

The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) notifies new standards or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On March 31, 2023, the MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, as below:

# Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements

The amendment requires the entities to disclose their material accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies. The effective date for adoption of this amendment is annual periods beginning on or after April 1, 2023. The Group has evaluated the amendment and the impact of the amendment is insignificant in the Group’s financial statements.

# Ind AS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors

The amendment has introduced a definition of ‘accounting estimates’ and included amendments to Ind AS 8 to help entities distinguish changes in accounting policies from

# b. Income taxes

The Group's two major tax jurisdictions are India and the United States, though the Company also files tax returns in other overseas jurisdictions. Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid / recovered for uncertain tax positions.

In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, the Management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible.

The Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, the Management believes that the Group will realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced (Refer to Note 2.17).

# c. Business combinations and intangible assets

Business combinations are accounted for using Ind AS 103, Business Combinations. Ind AS 103 requires the identifiable intangible assets and contingent consideration to be fair valued in order to ascertain the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. These valuations are conducted by external valuation experts. Estimates are required to be made in determining the value of contingent consideration, value of option arrangements and intangible assets.

These measurements are based on information available at the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by the Management (Refer to Notes 2.1 and 2.4.2).

# d. Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment represent a significant proportion of the asset base of the Group. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values of Group's assets are determined by the Management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology (Refer to Note 2.2).

# e. Impairment of goodwill

Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of a Cash Generating Unit (CGUs) is less than its carrying amount. For the impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or groups of CGUs which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and which represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.

The recoverable amount of CGUs is determined based on higher of value-in-use and fair value less cost to sell. Key assumptions in the cash flow projections are prepared based on current economic conditions and comprises estimated long term growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and estimated operating margins (Refer to Note 2.4.1).

Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable, based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.

Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first evaluates whether it controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer. The Group considers whether it has the primary obligation to fulfil the contract, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the goods or service and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.

Goodwill: 630

Total purchase price: 981

(1) Includes cash and cash equivalents acquired of ₹26 crore.

The excess of the purchase consideration paid over the fair value of assets acquired has been attributed to goodwill. The primary items that generated this goodwill are the value of the acquired assembled workforce and estimated synergies, neither of which qualify as an intangible asset. Goodwill is not tax-deductible. Goodwill pertaining to these business combinations is allocated to operating segments as more fully described in Note 2.4.1.

The payments related to options issued by the Group over the non-controlling interests in its subsidiaries are accounted as financial liabilities and initially recognized at the estimated present value of gross obligations. Such options are subsequently measured at fair value in order to reflect the amount payable under the option at the date at which it becomes exercisable. In the event that the option expires unexercised, the liability is derecognized.

312 Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-23


The purchase consideration of ₹981 crore includes cash of ₹936 crore and contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of ₹45 crore as on the date of acquisition.

The undiscounted value of contingent consideration as of March 31, 2023 was ₹58 crore. Additionally, these acquisitions have shareholder and employee retention bonus payable to the employees of the acquiree over three years, subject to their continuous employment with the Group along with achievement of financial targets for the respective years. Performance and Retention bonus is recognized in employee benefit expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss over the period of service.

# 2.2 Property, plant and equipment

# Accounting policy

Costs directly attributable to acquisition are capitalized until the property, plant and equipment are ready for use, as intended by the Management. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived at after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The Group depreciates property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows :

| Buildings              | 22-25 years                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Plant and machinery    | 5 years                                         |
| Office equipment       | 5 years                                         |
| Computer equipment     | 3-5 years                                       |
| Furniture and fixtures | 5 years                                         |
| Vehicles               | 5 years                                         |
| Leasehold improvements | Lower of useful life of the asset or lease term |

(1) Based on technical evaluation, the Management believes that the useful lives, as given above, best represent the period over which the Management expects to use these assets. Hence, the useful lives for these assets is different from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013.

(2) Includes solar plant with a useful life of 25 years.

# 2.4 Goodwill and other intangible assets

A summary of changes in the carrying amount of goodwill is as follows:

# 2.4.1 Goodwill

Accounting policy

Goodwill represents the purchase consideration in excess of the Group's interest in the net fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity.

When the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired exceeds purchase consideration, the fair value of net assets acquired is reassessed and the bargain purchase gain is recognized in capital reserve. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

# Impairment

Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of a Cash Generating Unit (CGU) is less than its carrying amount. For the impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or groups of CGUs which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and which represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets. Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of a CGU including the goodwill, exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. Value-in-use is the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from the CGU. Key assumptions in the cash flow projections are prepared based on current economic conditions and includes estimated long term growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and estimated operating margins.

# The allocation of goodwill to operating segments as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 is as follows:

316 Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-23


The goodwill pertaining to Panaya amounting to ₹959 crore and ₹886 crore as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively is tested for impairment at the entity level. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. The fair value of a CGU is determined based on the market capitalization. Value-in-use is determined based on discounted future cash flows. The key assumptions used for the calculations are as follows :

| Particulars           | As at March 31, 2023 | As at March 31, 2022 |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Long-term growth rate | 8-10                 | 8-10                 |
| Operating margins     | 19-21                | 19-21                |
| Discount rate         | 13                   | 12                   |

The above discount rate is based on the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of the Company. As at March 31, 2023, the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU exceeded its carrying amount. Reasonable sensitivities in key assumptions is unlikely to cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount of the cash generating units.

# 2.4.2 Other intangible assets

# Accounting policy

Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Intangible assets are amortized over their respective individual estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset is based on a number of factors, including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, and known technological advances) and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end.

Research costs are expensed as incurred. Software product development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and commercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future economic benefits are probable, the Group has an intention and ability to complete and use or sell the software and the costs can be measured reliably. The costs which can be capitalized include the cost of material, direct labor, and overhead costs that are directly attributable to prepare the asset for its intended use.

# Impairment

Intangible assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs.

If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. An impairment loss is reversed in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of any accumulated amortization) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.

The changes in the carrying value of acquired intangible assets for the year ended March 31, 2023 are as follows :

# 2.11 Financial instruments

# Accounting policy

# 2.11.1 Initial recognition

The Group recognizes financial assets and financial liabilities when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities, which are not at fair value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial recognition. Regular way purchase and sale of financial assets are accounted for at trade date.

# 2.11.2 Subsequent measurement

a. Non-derivative financial instruments

(i) Financial assets carried at amortized cost

A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortized cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

(ii) Financial assets carried at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

A financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the

# Consolidated Financial Statements

Financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The Group has made an irrevocable election for its investments which are classified as equity instruments to present the subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income based on its business model.

# (iii) Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss

A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above categories is subsequently fair valued through profit or loss.

# (iv) Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method, except for contingent consideration and financial liability under option arrangements recognized in a business combination, which is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.

Or is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognized in cash flow hedging reserve, till the period the hedge was effective, remains in cash flow hedging reserve until the forecasted transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in the cash flow hedging reserve is transferred to the net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss upon the occurrence of the related forecasted transaction. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified to net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

# 2.11.3 Derecognition of financial instruments

The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109. A financial liability (or a part of a financial liability) is derecognized from the Group's Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.

# b. Derivative financial instruments

The Group holds derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts, to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for such contracts is generally a bank.

# (i) Financial assets or financial liabilities, carried at fair value through profit or loss

This category includes derivative financial assets or liabilities which are not designated as hedges. Although the Group believes that these derivatives constitute hedges from an economic perspective, they may not qualify for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments. Any derivative that is either not designated as hedge, or is so designated but is ineffective as per Ind AS 109, is categorized as a financial asset or financial liability, at fair value through profit or loss.

Derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized initially at fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognized in net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, these derivatives are measured at fair value through profit or loss and the resulting exchange gains or losses are included in other income. Assets / liabilities in this category are presented as current assets / current liabilities if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realized within 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.

# (ii) Cash flow hedge

The Group designates certain foreign exchange forward and options contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecasted cash transactions. When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized immediately in the net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognized in cash flow hedging reserve, till the period the hedge was effective, remains in cash flow hedging reserve until the forecasted transaction occurs.

# 2.11.4 Fair value of financial instruments

In determining the fair value of its financial instruments, the Group uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each reporting date. The methods used to determine fair value include discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing model, market multiples, available quoted market prices and dealer quotes. All methods of assessing fair value result in general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized. Refer to table 'Financial instruments by category' below for the disclosure on carrying value and fair value of financial assets and liabilities. For financial assets and liabilities maturing within one year from the Balance Sheet date and which are not carried at fair value, the carrying amounts approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

# 2.11.5 Impairment

The Group recognizes loss allowances using the expected credit loss (ECL) model for the financial assets and unbilled revenue which are not fair valued through profit or loss. Loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues with no significant financing component is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, ECLs are measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition, in which case those are measured at lifetime ECL.

The Group determines the allowance for credit losses based on historical loss experience adjusted to reflect current and estimated future economic conditions. The Group considers current and anticipated future economic conditions relating to industries the Group deals with and the countries where it operates. The amount of ECL (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date to the amount that is required to be recorded is recognized as an impairment loss or gain in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

(1) On account of fair value changes including interest accrued

(2) Excludes interest accrued on tax-free bonds and government bonds carried at amortized cost of ₹91 crore

(3) Excludes unbilled revenue on contracts where the right to consideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones

For trade receivables, trade payables and other assets and payables maturing within one year from the Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate the fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

# Fair value hierarchy

- Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3 – Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

# Financial risk management

# Financial risk factors

The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's primary focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimize potential adverse effects on its financial performance. The primary market risk to the Group is foreign exchange risk. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate foreign exchange related risk exposures. The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristic of each customer and the concentration of risk from the top few customers.

# Market risk

The Group operates internationally and a major portion of the business is transacted in several currencies and consequently the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its sales and services in the United States and elsewhere, and purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. The Group holds derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts, to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The Group is also exposed to foreign exchange risk arising on intercompany transaction in foreign currencies. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the results of the Group’s operations are adversely affected as the rupee appreciates / depreciates against these currencies.

# The foreign currency risk from financial assets and liabilities as at March 31, 2023 is as follows:

# Derivative financial instruments

The Group holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for these contracts is generally a bank. These derivative financial instruments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.

During the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, the Group has designated certain foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecasted cash transactions. The related hedge transactions for balance in cash flow hedges as of March 31, 2023 are expected to occur and will be reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss within three months.

The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of its forecasted cash flows. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument, including whether the hedging instrument is expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items.

The reconciliation of cash flow hedge reserve for the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 is as follows:

Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by the counterparty resulting in a financial loss. The maximum exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily from trade receivables amounting to ₹25,424 crore and ₹22,698 crore as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively and unbilled revenues amounting to ₹16,738 crore and ₹12,509 crore as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively.

Credit risk has always been managed by the Group through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Group grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Group uses the expected credit loss model to assess any required allowances; and uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues. This matrix takes into account credit reports and other related credit information to the extent available.

As at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, 2,24,924 and 2,65,561 cash-settled options were outstanding, respectively. The carrying value of liability towards cash-settled, share-based payments was ₹4 crore and ₹13 crore as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively. The fair value of the awards are estimated using the Black-Scholes Model for time and non-market performance-based options and Monte Carlo simulation model is used for TSR-based options. The inputs to the model include the share price at date of grant, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends, expected term and the risk-free rate of interest. Expected volatility during the expected term of the options is based on historical volatility of the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the options. Expected volatility of the comparative company have been modelled based on historical movements in the market prices of their publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the options. Correlation coefficient is calculated between each peer entity and the indices as a whole or between each entity in the peer group.

# The fair value of each equity-settled award is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:

# 2.16 Provisions

# Accounting policy

A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that is reasonably estimable, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.

# a. Post-sales client support

The Group provides its clients with a fixed-period post-sales support on its fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts. Costs associated with such support services are accrued at the time related revenues are recorded and included in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. The Group estimates such costs based on historical experience and estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis for any material changes in assumptions and likelihood of occurrence.

Provision for post-sales client support and other provisions majorly represents costs associated with providing sales support services which are accrued at the time of recognition of revenues and are expected to be utilized over a period of one year. Provision for post-sales client support and other provisions is included in cost of sales in the condensed Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.


# 2.17 Income taxes

# Accounting policy

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred income tax. Income tax expense is recognized in net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in equity or other comprehensive income. Current income tax for current and prior periods is recognized at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date and are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of changes in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment or the substantive enactment date. A deferred income tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilized.

Deferred income taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and branches where it is expected that the earnings of the subsidiary or branch will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.

The Group offsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities; deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities; where it has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Tax benefits of deductions earned on exercise of employee share options in excess of compensation charged to income are credited to equity.

# Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss is as follows:

| Particulars        | Year ended March 31, | 2023  | 2022  |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ----- | ----- |
| Current taxes      |                      | 9,287 | 7,811 |
| Deferred taxes     |                      | (73)  | 153   |
| Income tax expense |                      | 9,214 | 7,964 |

Income tax expense for the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 includes reversal (net of provisions) of ₹106 crore and ₹268 crore, respectively. These reversals pertaining to prior periods are primarily on account of adjudication of certain disputed matters, upon filing of tax return and completion of assessments, across various jurisdictions.

# A reconciliation of the income tax provision to the amount computed by applying the statutory income tax rate to the income before income taxes is summarized below:

The applicable Indian corporate statutory tax rate for the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 is 34.94% each. The foreign tax expense is due to income taxes payable overseas principally in the US. In India, the Group has benefited from certain tax incentives that the Government of India had provided for export of software and services from the units registered under the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) Act, 2005. SEZ units, which began the provision of services on or after April 1, 2005 are eligible for a deduction of 100% of profits or gains derived from the export of services for the first five years from the financial year in which the unit commenced the provision of services and 50% of such profits or gains for further five years. Up to 50% of such profits or gains is also available for a further five years subject to creation of a Special Economic Zone Re-investment Reserve out of the profit of the eligible SEZ units and utilization of such reserve by the Group for acquiring new plant and machinery for the purpose of its business as per the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961.

Deferred income tax for the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 substantially relates to origination and reversal of temporary differences.



# Consolidated Financial Statements

Infosys is subject to a 15% Branch Profit Tax (BPT) in the US to the extent its US branch's net profit during the year is greater than the increase in the net assets of the US branch during the year, computed in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code. As at March 31, 2023, Infosys' US branch net assets amounted to approximately ₹6,948 crore. As at March 31, 2023, the Company has a deferred tax liability for Branch Profit Tax of ₹148 crore (net of credits), as the Company estimates that these branch profits are expected to be distributed in the foreseeable future.

Deferred income tax liabilities have not been recognized on temporary differences amounting to ₹10,948 crore and ₹9,618 crore as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively, associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches as the Company is able to control the timing of reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The Group majorly intends to repatriate earnings from subsidiaries and branches only to the extent these can be distributed in a tax-free manner.

Deferred income tax assets have not been recognized on accumulated losses of ₹4,423 crore and ₹4,487 crore as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively, as it is probable that future taxable profit will not be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilized in the foreseeable future.

# Deferred income tax assets and liabilities

| Particulars                                   | As at March 31, 2023 | 2022    |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------- |
| Deferred income tax assets after set-off      | 1,245                | 1,212   |
| Deferred income tax liabilities after set-off | (1,220)              | (1,156) |

In assessing the reliability of deferred income tax assets, the management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. The Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, the Management believes that the Group will realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced.

The Company’s Advanced Pricing Arrangement (APA) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for US branch income tax expired in March 2021. The Company has applied for renewal of APA and currently the US taxable income is based on the Company’s best estimate determined based on the expected value method.

The Group includes variable consideration as part of transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the variable consideration and when it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.

# Revenue from operations

# Accounting policy

The Group derives revenues primarily from IT services comprising software development and related services, cloud and infrastructure services, maintenance, consulting and package implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Group’s core and digital offerings (together called as “software-related services”) and business process management services. Contracts with customers are either on a time-and-material, unit of work, fixed-price or on a fixed-timeframe basis.

Revenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition and measurement when the contract has been approved in writing by the parties, the parties to the contract are committed to perform their respective obligations under the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services (“performance obligations”) to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Group has received or expects to receive in exchange for these products or services (“transaction price”). When there is uncertainty as to collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.

The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. The Group allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In cases where the Group is unable to determine...

344 Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-23



The standalone selling price, the Group uses the expected cost plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. For software development and related services, the performance obligations are satisfied as and when the services are rendered, since the customer generally obtains control of the work as it progresses.

Certain cloud and infrastructure services contracts include multiple elements which may be subject to other specific accounting guidance, such as leasing guidance. These contracts are accounted in accordance with such specific accounting guidance. In such arrangements where the Group is able to determine that hardware and services are distinct performance obligations, it allocates the consideration to these performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. In the absence of standalone selling price, the Group uses the expected cost-plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. When such arrangements are considered as a single performance obligation, revenue is recognized over the period and measure of progress is determined based on promise in the contract.

Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a “right to use” the licenses is recognized at the time the license are made available to the customer. Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a “right to access” is recognized over the access period.

Arrangements to deliver software products generally have three elements: license, implementation and Annual Technical Services (ATS). When implementation services are provided in conjunction with the licensing arrangement, and the license and implementation have been identified as two distinct separate performance obligations, the transaction price for such contracts are allocated to each performance obligation of the contract based on their relative standalone selling prices. In the absence of standalone selling price for implementation, the Group uses the expected cost-plus-margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. Where the license is required to be substantially customized as part of the implementation service, the entire arrangement fee for license and implementation is considered to be a single performance obligation and the revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method while the implementation is performed. Revenue from client training, support and other services arising due to the sale of software products is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied. ATS revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the period in which the services are rendered.

Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first evaluates whether it controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer. The Group considers whether it has the primary obligation to fulfil the contract, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the goods or service and, therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.

The incremental costs of obtaining a contract (i.e., costs that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained) are recognized as an asset if the Group expects to recover them.

Certain eligible, nonrecurring costs (e.g. set-up or transition or transformation costs) that do not represent a separate performance obligation are recognized as an asset when such costs (a) relate directly to the contract; (b) generate or enhance resources of the Group that will be used in satisfying the performance obligation in the future; and (c) are expected to be recovered.

Capitalized contract costs, relating to upfront payments to customers, are amortized to revenue and other capitalized costs are amortized to expenses over the respective contract life on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods or services to customer to which the asset relates. Capitalized costs are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when the present value of projected remaining operating cash flows is not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the capitalized costs.

The Group presents revenues net of indirect taxes in its Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

# Core services

Core Services comprise traditional offerings of the Group that have scaled and industrialized over a number of years. These primarily include application management services, proprietary application development services, independent validation solutions, product engineering and management, infrastructure management services, traditional enterprise application implementation, support and integration services.

The percentage of revenue from fixed-price contracts for each of the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 is approximately 52% and 53%, respectively.

# Trade Receivables and Contract Balances

The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in receivables, unbilled revenue, and unearned revenue on the Group’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) or upon achievement of contractual milestones.

346 Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-23

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-23

The Group’s receivables are rights to consideration that are unconditional. Unbilled revenues, comprising revenues in excess of billings from time and material contracts and fixed-price maintenance contracts are classified as financial asset when the right to consideration is unconditional and is due only after a passage of time.

Invoicing to the clients for other fixed-price contracts is based on milestones as defined in the contract and, therefore, the timing of revenue recognition is different from the timing of invoicing to the customers. Therefore, unbilled revenues for other fixed-price contracts (contract asset) are classified as non-financial asset because the right to consideration depends on completion of contractual milestones.

Invoicing in excess of earnings are classified as unearned revenue.

Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of impairment in the consolidated Balance Sheet.

During the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, the Company recognized revenue of ₹5,387 crore and ₹3,551 crore arising from opening unearned revenue as of April 1, 2022 and April 1, 2021, respectively.

During the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, ₹5,950 crore and ₹4,047 crore of unbilled revenue pertaining to other fixed-price and fixed-time frame contracts as of April 1, 2022 and April 1, 2021, respectively has been reclassified to Trade receivables upon billing to customers on completion of milestones.

# 2.19 Other income, net

# Accounting policy

Other income is comprised primarily of interest income, dividend income, gain / loss on investment and exchange gain / loss on forward and options contracts, and on translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive payment is established.

# Foreign currency – Accounting policy

# Functional currency

The functional currency of Infosys, Infosys BPM, EdgeVerve, Skava, Infosys Green Forum and controlled trusts is the Indian Rupee. The functional currencies for foreign subsidiaries are their respective local currencies. These financial statements are presented in Indian rupees (rounded off to crore; one crore equals ten million).

# Transactions and translations

Foreign-currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated into the relevant functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the Balance Sheet date. The gains or losses resulting from such translations are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss and reported within exchange gains / (losses) on translation of assets and liabilities, net, except when deferred in Other Comprehensive Income as qualifying cash flow hedges. Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of transaction. The related revenue and expense are recognized using the same exchange rate.

Transaction gains or losses realized upon settlement of foreign currency transactions are included in determining net profit for the period in which the transaction is settled. Revenue, expense and cash-flow items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currencies using the exchange rate in effect on the date of the transaction.

The translation of financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries to the presentation currency is performed for assets and liabilities using the exchange rate in effect at the Balance Sheet date and for revenue, expense and cash-flow items using the average exchange rate for the respective periods. The gains or losses resulting from such translation are included in currency translation reserves under other components of equity. When a subsidiary is disposed off, in full, the relevant amount is transferred to net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. However when a change in the parent's ownership does not result in loss of control of a subsidiary, such changes are recorded through equity.

Other comprehensive income, net of taxes includes translation differences on non-monetary financial assets measured at fair value at the reporting date, such as equities classified as financial instruments and measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).

# 2.21 Leases

# Accounting policy

# The Group as a lessee

The Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for land, buildings and computers. The Group assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether: (1) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (2) the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.

At the date of commencement of the lease, the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

As a lessee, the Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. The Group makes an assessment on the expected lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Company considers factors such as any significant leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of the lease and the importance of the underlying asset to Group’s operations taking into account the location of the underlying asset and the availability of suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current economic circumstances.

Certain lease arrangements include the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.

The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. Right-of-use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Group changes its assessment to whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option.

Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash flows.

# The Group as a lessor

Leases for which the Group is a lessor is classified as a finance or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.

For operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

The changes in the carrying value of right-of-use assets for the year ended March 31, 2023 are as follows :

(1) For domestic defined benefit plan in India, the market for high quality corporate bonds being not developed, the yield of government bonds is considered as the discount rate. For most of our overseas defined benefit plan, given that the market for high quality corporate bonds is not developed, the Government bond rate adjusted for corporate spreads is used.

(2) The average rate of increase in compensation levels is determined by the Company, considering factors such as, the Company’s past compensation revision trends, inflation in respective markets and the Management’s estimate of future salary increases.

(3) Attrition rate considered is the Management’s estimate based on the past long-term trend of employee turnover in the Company. The tenure has been considered taking into account the past long-term trend of employees' average remaining service life which reflects the average estimated term of post-employment benefit obligation.

Consolidated Financial Statements

For domestic defined benefit plan in India, assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set in accordance with the published statistics by the Life Insurance Corporation of India. For overseas defined benefit plan, the assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set with regard to the latest statistics in life expectancy, plan experience and other relevant data.

The Group assesses all of the above assumptions with its projected long-term plans of growth and prevalent industry standards. The Company contributes all ascertained liabilities towards gratuity to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust. In case of Infosys BPM and EdgeVerve, contributions are made to the Infosys BPM Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust and EdgeVerve Systems Limited Employees Gratuity Fund Trust, respectively.

Trustees administer contributions made to the trust as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, and contributions for gratuity are invested in a scheme with the Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law. The plan assets of the overseas defined benefit plan have been primarily invested in insurer managed funds and the asset allocation for plan assets is determined based on the investment criteria prescribed under the relevant regulations applicable to pension funds and the insurer managers. The insurers' investment are well diversified and also provide for guaranteed interest rates arrangements.

Actual return on assets (including remeasurements) of the Gratuity Plan for the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 were ₹129 crore and ₹120 crore, respectively and for the pension plan were (₹91) crore and ₹56 crore, respectively. The contributions for gratuity are invested in a scheme with the Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law.

The details of major plan assets into various categories as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 are as follows:

converting the lump-sum to a pension and there is the risk that the members live longer than implied by these conversion rates and that the pension assets don’t achieve the investment return implied by these conversion rates.

Asset volatility: A proportion of the pension fund is held in equities, which is expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long term but give exposure to volatility and risk in the short term. The pension fund board of insurer is responsible for the investment strategy and equity allocation is justified given the long-term investment horizon of the pension fund and the objective to provide a reasonable long term return on members’ account balances.

# The sensitivity of significant assumptions used for valuation of defined benefit obligation is as follows:

| Impact from                                              | As at March 31, 2023 |         |

|                                                          | Gratuity             | Pension |
| 1% point increase / decrease                             | 94                   | 40      |
| Weighted average rate of increase in compensation levels | 85                   | 5       |

Sensitivity to significant actuarial assumptions is computed by varying one actuarial assumption used for the valuation of the defined benefit obligation and keeping all other actuarial assumptions constant. In practice, this is not probable, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. The Group expects to contribute ₹219 crore to gratuity and ₹40 crore to pension during the fiscal 2024.

# The maturity profile of defined benefit obligation is as follows:

These defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risk which are set out below:

Interest rate risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is generally calculated using a discount rate determined with reference to government bond yields and in certain overseas jurisdictions, it is calculated in reference to government bond yield adjusted for a corporate spread. If bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.

Life expectancy and investment risk: The pension fund offers the choice between a lifelong pension and a cash lump-sum upon retirement. The pension fund has defined rates for

(1) In India, the market for high quality corporate bonds being not developed, the yield of government bonds is considered as the discount rate. The tenure has been considered taking into account the past long-term trend of employees’ average remaining service life which reflects the average estimated term of the post-employment benefit obligations.

The asset allocation for plan assets is determined based on the investment criteria prescribed under the relevant regulations. The actuarial valuation of PF liability exposes the Group to interest rate risk. The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a discount rate based on government bonds. If bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.

As at March 31, 2023, the defined benefit obligation would be affected by approximately ₹48 crore and ₹97 crore on account of a 0.25% increase / decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets.

# 2.23 Reconciliation of basic and diluted shares used in computing earnings per equity share

# Accounting policy

Basic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the Group by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the Group by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per equity share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. The dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for the proceeds receivable, had the equity shares been actually issued at fair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding equity shares). Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as at the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date. Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently for each period presented.

The number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any share splits and bonus shares issues, including for changes effected prior to the approval of the financial statements by the Board of Directors.

# Accounting policy

Contingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events, not wholly within the control of the entity, or a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

* Uncalled capital pertaining to investments

(1) As at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, claims against the Group not acknowledged as debts in respect of income tax matters amounted to ₹4,062 crore and ₹4,001 crore, respectively. The claims against the Group primarily represent demands arising on completion of assessment proceedings under the Income-tax Act, 1961. These claims are on account of multiple issues of disallowances, such as disallowance of profits earned from STP Units and SEZ Units, disallowance of deductions in respect of employment of new employees under Section 80JJAA, disallowance of expenditure towards software being held as capital in nature, and payments made to Associated Enterprises held as liable for withholding of taxes. These matters are pending before various Income Tax Authorities and the Management including its tax advisors expect that its position will likely be upheld on ultimate resolution, and will not have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial position and results of operations. Amount paid to statutory authorities against the tax claims amounted to ₹6,528 crore and ₹5,996 crore as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively.

(2) Capital contracts primarily comprise commitments for infrastructure facilities and computer equipments.

# Legal proceedings

# 2.26 Segment reporting

Ind AS 108, Operating segments, establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments and related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The Group's operations predominantly relate to providing end-to-end business solutions to enable clients to enhance business performance. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) evaluates the Group's performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by business segments. Accordingly, information has been presented along business segments. The accounting principles used in the preparation of the financial statements are consistently applied to record revenue and expenditure in individual segments, and are as set out in the accounting policies.

Business segments of the Group are primarily enterprises in Financial Services and Insurance, enterprises in Manufacturing, enterprises in Retail, Consumer Packaged Goods and Logistics, enterprises in the Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services, enterprises in Communication, Telecom OEM and Media, enterprises in Hi-Tech, enterprises in Life Sciences and Healthcare and all other segments. The Financial services reportable segments has been aggregated to include the Financial Services operating segment and Finacle operating segment because of the similarity of the economic characteristics. All other segments represent the operating segments of businesses in India, Japan and China, Infosys Public Services and other enterprises in Public Services.

Revenue and identifiable operating expenses in relation to segments are categorized based on items that are individually identifiable to that segment. Revenue for 'all other segments' represents revenue generated by Infosys Public services and revenue generated from customers located in India, Japan and China and other enterprises in Public Services. Allocated expenses of segments include expenses incurred for rendering services from the Group's offshore software development centers and on-site expenses, which are categorized in relation to the associated efforts of the segment. Certain expenses such as depreciation and amortization, which form a significant component of total expenses, are not specifically allocable to specific segments as the underlying assets are used interchangeably. The Management believes that it is not practical to provide segment disclosures relating to those costs and expenses, and accordingly these expenses are separately disclosed as "unallocated" and adjusted against the total income of the Group.

Assets and liabilities used in the Group's business are not identified to any of the reportable segments, as these are used interchangeably between segments. The Management believes that it is currently not practicable to provide segment disclosures relating to total assets and liabilities since a meaningful segregation of the available data is onerous.

Business segment revenue information is collated based on individual customers invoiced or in relation to which the revenue is otherwise recognized. Disclosure of revenue by geographic locations is given in Note 2.18, Revenue from operations.

# Notes

1. Pursuant to the General Circular No. 10/2022 dated December 28, 2022, issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) and Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD-2/P/CIR/2023/4 dated January 5, 2023 issued by SEBI (hereinafter collectively referred to as “the Circulars”), companies are allowed to hold AGM through VC, without the physical presence of members at a common venue. Hence, in compliance with the Circulars, the AGM of the Company is being held through VC.
2. A member entitled to attend and vote at the AGM is entitled to appoint a proxy to attend and vote on his / her behalf and the proxy need not be a member of the Company. Since the AGM is being held in accordance with the Circulars through VC, the facility for the appointment of proxies by the members will not be available.
3. Participation of members through VC will be reckoned for the purpose of quorum for the AGM as per Section 103 of the Act.
4. Members of the Company under the category of Institutional Investors are encouraged to attend and vote at the AGM through VC. Corporate members intending to authorize their representatives to participate and vote at the meeting are requested to send a certified copy of the Board resolution / authorization letter to the Scrutinizer by email to evoting@infosys.com with a copy marked to evoting@nsdl.co.in.
5. The register of directors and key managerial personnel (KMP) and their shareholding, maintained under Section 170 of the Act, and the register of contracts or arrangements in which the directors are interested, maintained under Section 189 of the Act, will be available electronically for inspection by the members during the AGM. All documents referred to in the Notice will also be available for electronic inspection without any fee from the date of circulation of this Notice up to the date of AGM, i.e. June 28, 2023. Members seeking to inspect such documents can send an email to investors@infosys.com.
6. Members whose shareholding is in electronic mode are requested to notify any change in address or bank account details to their respective depository participant(s) (DP). Members whose shareholding is in physical mode are requested to opt for the Electronic Clearing System (ECS) mode to receive dividend on time in line with the Circulars. We urge members to utilize the ECS for receiving dividends. Please refer to point no. 16 for the process to be followed for updating bank account details.
7. Members may note that the Board, at its meeting held on April 13, 2023, has recommended a final dividend of ₹17.5 per share. The record date for the purpose of final dividend for fiscal 2023 is June 2, 2023. The final dividend, once approved by the members in the ensuing AGM, will be paid on July 3, 2023, electronically through various online transfer modes to those members who have updated their bank account details. For members who have not updated their bank account details, dividend warrants / demand drafts / cheques will be sent to their registered addresses. To avoid delay in receiving dividend, members are requested to update their KYC with their depositories (where shares are held in dematerialized mode) and with the Company’s Registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA) (where shares are held in physical mode) to receive the dividend directly into their bank account on the payout date.
8. Members may note that the Income-tax Act, 1961, (“the IT Act”) as amended by the Finance Act, 2020, mandates that dividend paid or distributed by a company on or after April 1, 2020 shall be taxable in the hands of members. The Company shall therefore be required to deduct tax at source (TDS) at the time of making the payment of final dividend. To enable us to determine the appropriate TDS rate as applicable, members are requested to submit relevant documents, as specified in the below paragraphs, in accordance with the provisions of the IT Act.

# Independent Director

Bobby Parikh is the Managing Partner of Bobby Parikh Associates, a boutique firm focused on providing strategic tax and regulatory advisory services. Over the years, Bobby has had extensive experience in advising clients across a range of industries. India has witnessed significant deregulation and a progressive transformation of its policy framework. An area of focus for Bobby has been to work with businesses, both Indian and multinational, in interpreting the implications of the deregulation as well as the changes to India’s policy framework, to help businesses better leverage opportunities that have become available and to address challenges that resulted from such changes. He has led teams that have advised clients in the areas of entry strategy (MNCs into India and Indian companies into overseas markets), business model identification, structuring a business presence, mergers, acquisitions and other business reorganizations.

Bobby’s particular area of focus is providing tax and regulatory advice in relation to transactions and other forms of business reorganizations, whether inbound, outbound or wholly domestic. In this regard, he works extensively with private equity funds, other institutional investors and owners and managers of businesses to develop bespoke solutions that optimally address the commercial objectives underpinning a particular transaction or a business reorganization. He also works closely with regulators and policy formulators in providing inputs to aid in the development of new regulations and policies, and in assessing the implications and efficacy of these and providing feedback for action.

Bobby was most recently co-founder of BMR Advisors, a highly regarded tax and transactions firm which he helped establish and run for over 12 years. Prior to forming BMR Advisors, Bobby was the Chief Executive Officer of Ernst &#x26; Young in India and held that responsibility until December 2003.
