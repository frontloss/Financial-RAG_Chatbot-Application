# Building enterprises in the age of AI

Over the past two years, we’ve seen rapid growth in AI awareness, usage, and investment. The hunger to learn fast and experiment faster has been insatiable. With growing ease of use and increasing access to AI assistants, co-pilots and tools, AI use-cases and pilots have mushroomed and burgeoned across the enterprise, with some value realized. The unbridled enthusiasm around AI has meant that CXOs are no longer having to advocate for the value of AI within the enterprise. Instead, they can invest now in scaling, driving adoption and governing.

The distinct opportunity is to build with AI to amplify the potential of employees, and modernize systems and how they empower people working within the organization, to increase efficiency, productivity, and innovation. This in turn can transform the value these businesses can bring to their customers. By strategically implementing AI and ensuring it complements human capabilities, businesses can significantly improve customer proposition and service, leading to increased satisfaction, loyalty, and ultimately, better business outcomes.

This endeavor can be multi-tiered and complex. AI experiments are often heterogeneous, requiring diverse data and tech stacks that necessitate building entire new architectural foundations before value can be realized. There is also the need to focus on making sure that AI systems are used fairly and responsibly so that they can truly serve the enterprise at scale.

Applying AI at a scale that can power the entire enterprise involves building AI capabilities mindfully. This entails nurturing a robust data strategy, investing in AI infrastructure optimization, while also systemically building capacity to deepen algorithmic efficiencies and improve model performance. In many ways, this is about reframing the status quo for an AI-first future – with sustained value in mind. Leaders embrace a hybrid approach to power their AI flywheels. They need flexibility of infrastructure – both rental and owned models – to bring them the control that they need over the environment, along with the potential to drive efficiencies in the long run, in addition to security and compliance efficiencies as well.

We are building templates for AI success – industry after industry, business after business – for enterprise-scale value generation for our clients. We are helping them AI their enterprise in ways that are changing the game for them today and giving them a head start into the future. Some interesting examples, as case studies, make for interesting and quick reading later in this Integrated Annual Report. In many ways, it’s exactly what you’d expect from a partner whose promise to enterprises is – navigate your next.

# Americana Restaurants: Reimagining Accounts Payable with agentic AI

Americana Restaurants is the largest out-of-home dining and quick-service restaurant operator in their 12 countries of operation across the Middle East and North Africa. With strong franchisor partnerships and a diverse portfolio of iconic global brands, including KFC, Pizza Hut, Hardee’s, Krispy Kreme, Peet’s Coffee, Wimpy, TGI Friday’s, Costa Coffee, and Baskin Robbins, the company delivers world-class dining experiences. Their growth, in recent years, has been so rapid that it was starting to strain their technology infrastructure, exposing limitations in their ability to scale to demand. They sought out Infosys’ expertise to help them establish a state-of-the-art BPM framework that would bring transparency and efficiency into their process ecosystem while prioritizing their vital enterprise Accounts Payable processes for AI-powered transformation.

Infosys started at the foundation, completely reimagining Americana Restaurants’ document-centric workflows for an enterprise set to turn AI-first. The deployment of Infosys Accounts Payable Solution on the cloud and its application enterprise-wide ensured that Americana Restaurants significantly improved efficiency, reducing processing times, minimizing errors, and optimizing costs. The integration of agentic AI that followed has made their invoice processing largely autonomous. AI agents process invoices end-to-end and offer support for multiple languages while managing complex validations and diverse expense types and processing exceptions with minimal human intervention. When required, users enjoy a highly intuitive user interface that only requires them to access a very simple training that serves them well across devices, from desktops to mobiles.

Infosys’ agentic AI-powered cloud-based Accounts Payable solution is among the first of its kind anywhere in the world that empowers Americana Restaurants to:

- Not only process invoices with minimal human intervention but predict and plan for future transactions
- Adapt the accounts payable environment dynamically to process deviations, reduce errors, and increase accuracy
- Leverage Microsoft Azure GPT-4 Omni for continuous learning and operational improvements

“Our partnership with Infosys has helped us embrace enterprise AI and transform the way we manage finance operations. With AI, our invoice processing is faster, more accurate, and far more future-proofed. This leap forward has also meant bringing more intelligence into our Accounts Payable, and we are looking to apply that learning into other areas of our organization.”

– Harsh Bansal, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Growth Officer, Americana Restaurants

Posti is a versatile, modern, and international logistics company with nearly 400 years of experience. Today, the company connects people and companies with postal services, parcels, e-commerce, and freight services, in addition to warehouse and logistics across the Nordic and Baltic countries. Posti was early to embrace the power of enterprise AI to accelerate the transformation of its IT landscape and amplify its ability to deliver exceptional services, optimize operations, and strengthen its position as a leading delivery and logistics provider.

In partnership with Infosys, Posti was quick to create an AI-powered efficient and customer centric organization with:

- Proactive IT operations management: Posti leverages GitHub Copilot to accelerate legacy code comprehension and improve its application lifecycle management. Furthermore, the deployment of Nanoheal, a self-help/self-heal tool, along with a generative AI-powered chatbot, drives proactive resolution of IT incidents across the company. These innovations have also resulted in reduced support call volumes for the organization along with dips of almost 40% in Mean Time to Resolution.
- Enhanced operational efficiency and observability: By implementing Infosys’ Live Enterprise Application Management Platform with embedded generative AI capabilities, Posti has fully transformed its business process monitoring. The Platform addresses visibility gaps, enabling automated monitoring and AI-based incident triaging. By correlating insights from the Infosys platform with its other platforms, Posti has a comprehensive unified view of its entire IT landscape. This has dramatically reduced critical process downtime for the company by over 90%, and helped it shift from reactive to predictive incident management.
- Accelerated application development: GitHub Copilot has significantly increased the pace of Posti’s software development lifecycle. The capability has boosted the company’s application lifecycle productivity by approximately 35%, accelerating both application development and deployment. This enables Posti to bring new and enhanced services to market faster, strengthening its competitive edge in a fast-changing marketplace.

“As we navigate the next phase of our evolution with enterprise AI, with Infosys, Posti will not only become a leader in the logistics and e-commerce sector, but a true digital frontrunner in the Nordics.” – Petteri Naulapää, CIO and SVP, ICT and Digitalisation, Posti Group

# Performance overview

# Chairman’s message

# An era of uncertainty

As we contemplate the developments of the last few months, we know we are in an era of uncertainty that we have never seen before. Multiple trends are colliding and leading us to reexamine the fundamentals of our businesses.

As geopolitics becomes front and centre in our lives, we are having to take cognizance of the world not as one single global market but as fragmented blocs and countries. This means making strategic choices and even navigating between these blocs. COVID brought into focus the critical and pressing need to derisk our supply chain and build viable alternatives. It was no longer enough to deliver just-in-time; we had to also factor in for just-in-case. Now tariffs are further driving home the point that we need to diversify our sourcing. Tariffs will be differentiated across products and countries and will likely keep changing.

Bilateral and regional rules of trade will dominate. Supply chains will continue to shift as tariffs become another form of arbitrage. Amid these growing uncertainties, there is a certainty that Infosys brings, that is of immense value to enterprises.

The Infosys basket of products and services is diversified across geographies, verticals and technologies with solutions to both traditional and emerging business challenges. These solutions are created to support clients’ investments in growth as well as for when they are cutting back on costs. Infosys is differentiated by its continuous and active investments in nurturing an engaged and committed workforce. A big part of this investment is in creating flexible training and skilling capability so that this workforce is always abreast of changing technology and business practices.

There is also a relentless focus on productivity, so business investments work harder. Even as Infosys strives to be a truly AI-first company, there is a simultaneous and equal focus on being at the forefront of sustainability. In every way, we seek to continue to rank among the world’s most respected companies.

We’ve always believed in enthusiastically embracing change. After all, our brand’s promise to our stakeholders is to help them navigate their next. We also have immense confidence stemming from our fortress balance sheet – characterized by high liquidity, zero debt, and the ability to withstand uncertainty. Above all, at Infosys, we remain fully aligned on strategy, yet tactically agile, having high mutual trust and responsiveness to customers, investors and employee needs.

So many things have changed. Then again, some things remain unchanged.

Performance overview

# Letter to the Shareholder

Dear shareholder,

Financial year 2025 was another year of strong execution for Infosys. We had growth of 4.2%, operating margin of 21.1%, and free cash flow of US$4.1 billion. We announced a total dividend of `43 per share (including an interim dividend of `21 per share).

Infosys is the leader in AI, cloud, data, and digital for our clients.

Infosys Topaz brings the power of AI, with a strong foundation of cloud and data, to help our clients leverage the next generation of opportunities. To help our clients with AI, we have built a repository of AI agents. These agents improve productivity in areas such as code generation, IT operations, bill-to-cash, and quote-to-order. We have developed domain-specific language models for some industries, IT operations, and cybersecurity. As a result of our expertise and strong partnership with industry leaders, we are now offering model development as a service to our customers.

Our Cobalt cloud capabilities provide the foundation for AI. We are working with the leading public cloud providers, private cloud players, SaaS companies, and PaaS platforms. Data is another foundational element for AI. Our capabilities in data architecture and managing structured and unstructured data give our clients confidence to use their data for enterprise AI deployment.

Our expertise across enterprise solutions, engineering services, cybersecurity, applications, infrastructure, and operations continues to drive value creation for our clients. We have continued our focus on cost efficiency, automation, lean, and delivering productivity improvements for our clients.

With our deep expertise across AI, cloud, data, digital, and cost efficiency offerings, we are well-established as the preferred partner for large enterprises across the world.

During the year, Infosys was recognized as a top 100 most valuable brand in the world and ranked among the most trusted brands in the US, by Kantar BrandZ. For the fifth consecutive year, we were recognized as one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies.

We recruited over 15,000 college graduates in the year and ended the year with over 3,20,000 employees. 39% of our workforce are women employees.

The Infosys Foundation continues to create positive impact by supporting the communities we work with, in the areas of healthcare, education, women empowerment, and sustainability. Over the year, the Foundation impacted over 1 crore lives through its outreach programs. Infosys Springboard, our free skilling platform, is helping build digital skills globally and has already provided free learning programs to 9.2 million people around the world.

Our client relationships have been the foundation of success through the years. We thank our clients for their continued trust and partnership.

We value the enormous contribution of our over 3,20,000 employees for making our clients successful. Their dedication and continued pursuit of excellence have enabled sustained value creation for our clients.

Thanks to our Board for their guidance and support for our strategic direction.

As technology continues to be more central in the world, Infosys becomes more relevant to our clients.

I remain optimistic about the enormous opportunities we have for the future.

With my warmest regards,

Sd/-

# Natural Capital

Decades before climate change emerged as a global boardroom priority, Infosys had recognized that natural capital is integral to long-term value creation. Our approach to managing environmental impact is holistic, scientific, and anchored in responsible growth. We have pledged to maintain carbon neutrality across Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. Our commitment goes beyond compliance – it is about leading by example and setting new standards in corporate climate responsibility.

# Material topics

- Carbon neutrality
- Renewable energy
- Offsets for community development
- Advocacy for climate action
- Water stewardship
- Zero waste to landfill

To date, our carbon offset initiatives have benefited over 2,72,000 rural families and created more than 3,900 local jobs. We see these efforts not only as a way to meet our climate goals but also as an opportunity to uplift communities and improve lives.

# Waste management: Towards a circular economy

At Infosys, our waste strategy is grounded in the principles of reduction, recovery, and reuse. We are steadily advancing towards our goal of zero waste to landfills. The initiative brings together global experts, policymakers, and industry leaders to shape a future where India’s buildings are radically more sustainable. With a goal of demonstrating 100 million sq.ft. of super-efficient commercial real estate as living case studies, enabling the replication of climate-resilient, energy-efficient infrastructure.

# Water stewardship: Conserving a vital resource

Water management has long been a cornerstone of our environmental strategy. As a signatory to the CEO Water Mandate, we are committed to minimizing water consumption and maximizing reuse. Our efforts continue to focus on improving water availability in the communities where we operate. Our campuses recycle 100% of wastewater and have effective rainwater harvesting techniques for utilizing rainwater effectively.

# Our 3-pillar strategy to climate action

1. Energy efficiency
2. Renewable energy
3. Carbon offsets

# Performance highlights

To operationalize our climate ambitions, we have built a robust strategy anchored on three pillars – energy efficiency, renewable energy, and carbon offsets.

# Climate positivity: The next frontier

As we progress toward environmental stewardship, we are evolving from climate neutrality towards climate positivity – a paradigm where our actions go beyond neutralizing emissions to actively creating a net environmental benefit. Climate positivity includes investing in regenerative practices and green innovations that restore ecosystems, sequestering more carbon than we emit, and strengthening the planet’s resilience.

At Infosys, we see this as a natural extension of our long-standing sustainability ethos. By embedding climate-positive thinking into our operations, products, and community programs, we aim to redefine what corporate climate leadership looks like in the coming decades. It’s not just about doing less harm, but about doing more good.

As we look to the future, we remain committed to being a catalyst for positive change, proving that sustainable development is not just possible – it is essential.

- Green buildings / infra / data center efficiency
- Workplace transformation
- Green IT

# UN SDG mapping

With the highest-rated green buildings on our campuses and investments in collaborative tech infrastructure, we offer productive, safe, healthy and hybrid workplaces for our employees. We continue to push the boundaries and define new benchmarks in environmental sustainability.

As a key stakeholder in the built environment, we recognize the urgent need to address embodied carbon – the emissions associated with building materials and construction processes. While operational efficiency has advanced, embodied carbon remains a significant contributor to climate impact. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a critical tool for understanding and reducing these emissions, guiding smarter material choices and sustainable design strategies. By integrating LCA early in the design process, we can make informed decisions that align with climate goals.

# Performance highlights

For a sustainable future, pushing the boundaries of energy efficiency in buildings is essential. Innovative design, advanced insulation, smart HVAC systems, and renewable energy integration are redefining possibilities. High-performance materials, passive solar techniques, and real-time energy monitoring reduce consumption and environmental impact. Net-zero and even energy-positive buildings are becoming viable goals. Emphasizing occupant comfort and health while minimizing resource use reflects a holistic approach to design.

The lush green campuses of Infosys, equipped with world-class infrastructure, provide a unique experience for our employees. With about 29.7 million sq.ft. of the highest level of green building certification, Infosys’ leadership in high-performance buildings remains unrivaled.

# New building design EPI

65 kWh/sq.m./p.a. in buildings is essential. Every aspect of a building – from insulation to high-performance glass and shading, efficient mechanical and electrical systems to high-efficiency equipment with variable speed, building management system to granular performance monitoring of individual equipment – has been thoroughly studied for improvement in every new building that we design and construct across Infosys.

# Radiant cooling solution

Patented in Europe and India, Radiflux technologies, and continuous performance monitoring and optimization have resulted in office buildings with an estimated Energy Performance Index (EPI) of lower than 65 kWh/sq.m. per annum.

# Majority of internal IT applications moved to public cloud infrastructure

All our employees have been enabled for cloud-based collaboration for messaging, presence, video, and other requirements. Additionally, cloud-based unified internet access and secure private access has enhanced hybrid work experience.

# Infrastructure as code

The shift to cloud has helped in optimizing the on-premises data center footprint and also to scale up the infra on demand and provision IT services seamlessly for all the new hires inducted into the organization.

# Impactful workplace design

Infosys continued on its workplace transformation journey, to adapt to the hybrid future-ready scenario. The principles of Infosys workplace strategy are focused on productivity, social connect, use of tech, health and wellness, sustainability and design for all. These are being followed in all new workplace designs of Infosys.

The new workplace designs align space with purpose, empowering people and teams to perform their best. We believe as work continues to evolve, so must our environments, making reimagined workplace design a catalyst for culture, innovation and long-term resilience.

# Capital Allocation Policy

"Effective from financial year 2025, the Company expects to continue its policy of returning approximately 85% of the free cash flow cumulatively over a five-year period through a combination of semi-annual dividends and / or share buyback / special dividends, subject to applicable laws and requisite approvals, if any." Under this policy, the Company expects to progressively increase its annual dividend per share (excluding special dividend, if any). Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditure as per the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows prepared under IFRS. Dividend and buyback include applicable taxes.

During the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company paid an interim dividend of ₹21 per equity share and announced a final dividend of ₹22 per share, subject to shareholders’ approval in the ensuing Annual General Meeting (AGM). Including the final dividend declared above, the Company has returned approximately ₹17,814 crore, which is 51.6% of the free cash flow for fiscal 2025 through dividends, in line with the Capital Allocation Policy.

The Capital Allocation Policy is available on our website, at https://www.infosys.com/investors/corporate-governance/documents/capital-allocation-policy.pdf.

# Liquidity

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, investments and the cash flow that we generate from our operations. We continue to be debt-free and maintain sufficient cash to meet our strategic and operational requirements. We understand that liquidity in the Balance Sheet has to balance between earning adequate returns and the need to cover financial and business requirements. Liquidity enables us to be agile and ready for meeting unforeseen strategic and business needs and opportunities.

As of March 31, 2025, we had ₹45,406 crore in working capital on a standalone basis, and ₹54,249 crore on a consolidated basis. Consolidated cash and investments stand at ₹35,916 crore on a standalone basis and ₹47,549 crore on a consolidated basis as on March 31, 2025, as against ₹30,579 crore on a standalone basis, and ₹39,005 crore on a consolidated basis as on March 31, 2024.

Consolidated cash and investments, on both standalone and consolidated basis, include deposits with banks with high credit ratings by international and domestic credit rating agencies. As a result, liquidity risk of cash and cash equivalents is limited. Ratings are monitored periodically. Liquid assets also include investments in liquid mutual fund units, target maturity funds units, Certificates of Deposit (CDs), Commercial Paper (CP), quoted bonds and securities issued by government and quasi-government organizations, and non-convertible debentures. CDs and CPs represent marketable securities of banks, Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and eligible financial institutions for a specified time period with high credit rating given by domestic credit rating agencies. Government securities are highly liquid and marketable instruments issued across tenure, backed by the Government of India carrying a sovereign credit. Investments made in non-convertible debentures are issued by government-owned institutions and financial institutions with high credit rating. We invest after considering counterparty risks based on multiple criteria including Tier-I capital, capital adequacy ratio, credit rating, profitability, Non Performing Asset (NPA) levels and deposit base of banks and financial institutions.

The details of these investments are disclosed under the ‘non-current and current investments’ section in the Standalone and Consolidated financial statements in this Integrated Annual Report.

# Annexure 3 – Particulars of employees

We are a leading provider of consulting, technology, outsourcing, and next-generation digital services. We enable clients across 59 countries to outperform their competition and stay ahead on the innovation curve. The remuneration and perquisites provided to our employees, including that of the Management, are on par with industry benchmarks. The Nomination and Remuneration committee continuously reviews the compensation of the CEO and Senior Management Personnel (SMP) to align both the short-term and long-term business objectives of the Company and to link compensation with the achievement of goals.

The details of remuneration to directors, Key Managerial Personnel and other employees are in compliance with Rule 5 of Chapter XIII, the Companies (Appointment and Remuneration of Managerial Personnel) Rules, 2014. In accordance with the requirements, tables 3(a) and 3(b) include the perquisite value of stock incentives at the time of their exercise and do not include the value of the stock incentives at the time of grant.

The change in remuneration in fiscal 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024 is primarily on account of change in perquisite value of stock incentives granted in previous years and exercised during the year and revision in compensation. The change in perquisite value of stock incentives exercised during the year also includes the impact of number of units exercised.

The Company has been implementing various CSR projects for holistic community development and institution building to serve the enrichment and evolution of businesses and communities. For fiscal 2025, the Company has engaged an external agency to provide support and assistance for an independent review and impact assessment.

# Methodology:

In order to assess the impact of its CSR projects, a mixed-method approach was deployed which involved either one of or both the quantitative and qualitative research tools (as relevant) for primary data collection. Using these tools, the team conducted interactions (virtual and on-field) with the project beneficiaries and other relevant stakeholders. Post data collection and analysis, the key insights and findings were collated in the form of a consolidated report for the Management’s consideration. This study was guided by the Inclusiveness, Relevance, Effectiveness, Convergence and Sustainability (IRECS) Framework which was used to provide overall feedback on the efficacy of implementation as well, as its efficiency in terms of achievement of the desired project outputs with reference to inputs.

# Summary:

During the year, impact assessment study was conducted on 26 eligible CSR projects which impacted 1.3 crore beneficiaries across various states in India. These projects align with the ESG framework and support 13 of the UN SDG goals which cover the broad themes of education, healthcare, women empowerment, sustainability and others.

Annexure 7 – Conservation of energy, research and development, technology absorption, foreign exchange earnings and outgo.

# Particulars pursuant to the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014

Our focused approach on energy efficiency, renewable energy and carbon offset projects over the years resulted in the Company achieving carbon neutrality for six years in a row since fiscal 2020, across all emissions. As we continue to remain carbon neutral for fiscal 2025, we have started to work towards climate positivity, aiming to restore more than we consume and to contribute actively to the health of our ecosystems and communities. We are thereby increasing our efforts in the global response to the threat of climate change.

# Renewable energy

Infosys has a total installed solar capacity of 60 MW across campuses including, a 40 MW captive solar plant in Karnataka. Additionally, the Company leverages Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and green tariffs to expand its clean energy portfolio. Infosys is steadily reducing its dependence on fossil fuels and accelerating the shift to a low-carbon future. In fiscal 2025, 77.7% of our electricity in India operations was met through renewables.

# Resource conservation initiatives

Resource conservation initiatives at Infosys have been focused, continuous and imbibed in our operations and new infrastructure development. The introduction of highly efficient new buildings, major improvements in existing buildings, intelligent automation, water management plans, and waste treatment and management projects have significantly reduced our environmental impact.

# Smarter spaces

Infosys is reimagining the future workplace through its “workplace transformation” initiative, aligning office design with hybrid work models and sustainability goals. Next generation offices are digitally connected, ergonomically designed, and powered by intelligent energy systems that adapt to real-time usage. Building Management Systems (BMS) optimize lighting, ventilation, and cooling to minimize energy waste. By promoting flexible working practices and creating energy-efficient, human-centered environments, we are enhancing employee well-being while significantly reducing our operational footprint.

# Energy

Infosys has demonstrated a strong commitment to energy conservation through a series of initiatives to improve operational efficiency and reduce overall consumption through cutting edge building designs, operational optimization and employee engagement. By combining innovative technologies with operational discipline, we have consistently reduced our energy intensity year after year. These efforts underscore Infosys’ belief that systematic, technology-driven conservation strategies are crucial to achieving meaningful progress towards sustainability goals. In fiscal 2025, while our new buildings were designed to new energy efficiency benchmarks, about `10.7 crore was spent on retrofits in some of our older infrastructure to improve operational efficiency.

# Water management

Committed to climate-positive goals, the Company ensures zero wastewater discharge, has endorsed the UN CEO Water Mandate, and aims to recharge more water than it consumes by 2030. Our efforts include demand reduction measures, wastewater recycling and rainwater harvesting initiatives. We have also implemented lake rejuvenation projects for larger community impact. Additionally, we are also sensitizing our employees on environmental protection and working with local stakeholders to improve water security to set industry benchmarks while addressing operational and ecological resilience.

# Waste management

We are aiming for zero waste to landfill while aligning with sustainability goals such as the GRI 306 and Scope 3 emissions standards. Infosys adopts the principles of circular economy to minimize environmental impact. Key initiatives around segregation, effective treatment and management have resulted in achieving over 98% waste diversion from landfill in fiscal 2025. Three of our campuses have achieved TRUE certification for zero waste by the Green Business Certification Institute.

# Carbon offset

Infosys addresses unavoidable emissions through community-based carbon offset projects. Projects in the clean cooking space implemented in four states across India have improved livelihoods and helped generate income for rural women.

94    Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25


We are also implementing large-scale carbon sequestration projects through nature-based solutions, including agroforestry initiatives. These projects go beyond environmental benefits, positively impacting small and marginal farmers by improving soil health, food security, and climate resilience.

Carbon neutral events: Infosys is committed to hosting carbon neutral events as part of its broader climate action strategy. Infosys ensures that all event-related emissions are carefully measured, minimized, and offset through certified projects. This approach not only reinforces the Company’s pledge toward climate positivity, but also demonstrates Infosys’ intent to extend our sustainability practices to external-facing events as well. In fiscal 2025, eight events organized by Infosys were declared carbon neutral.

Legacy on-premises platforms to scalable, faster, and efficient hybrid and cloud-based solutions. This supports modern management, fosters innovation, improves user experience, and ensures data security.

# Energy efficient IT infrastructure

We have adopted a multi-pronged strategy to make our network and computer workload energy-efficient and environment-friendly. Some of the measures implemented are:

- Energy efficient network infrastructure: InfosysIT uses network gears with power saving features to enhance energy efficiency.
- Public cloud adoption: Majority of internal IT applications have been moved to public cloud infrastructure. All our employees have been enabled for cloud-based collaboration for messaging, presence, video, and other requirements. In addition, cloud-based unified internet access and secure private access has improved hybrid work experience.

# Health, Safety and Environment

Our Health, Safety, and Environmental Management System (HSEMS) reflects our commitment to creating a safe, healthy, and sustainable workplace for employees, contractors, and visitors alike. Aligned with our broader climate and sustainability goals, Infosys is certified to ISO 14001:2015 for Environmental Management and ISO 45001:2018 for Occupational Health and Safety. The HSEMS is built on a strong framework of compliance, taking into account the needs of all stakeholders and ensuring adherence to applicable laws across all regions where we operate.

# Technology absorption

Live Enterprise@Infosys: An enterprise that senses, feels and responds in real-time – this has been the theme of our transformation journey in the recent years. We have used a mobile-first approach so that employees are connected to the organization wherever they are and can access the organization’s resources to learn and contribute. The response has been phenomenal as over 2,50,000 unique users use InfyMe mobile app every month for its 300+ features and more than 77,000 users have rated it 4.6/5 on the Google Play Store. With process bursting, we have seen many of our key processes become faster and more responsive. Following the overwhelming success in Infosys, we are also seeing interest of the Orbit platform (InfyMe version for our clients) and have more than 12 clients using the same.

Modern, hybrid, and secure workplace: Our hybrid workplace uses borderless ODCs, virtual collaboration tools, and self-service applications to enable employees to work from anywhere. Our IT management system protects data and our brand by continuously assessing vulnerabilities. Collaborative tools foster innovation and teamwork. Employees are enabled with AI-powered systems and tools to enhance productivity and decision-making, allowing the automation of repetitive tasks and improving customer experience. The cloud-first approach has helped in migrating our key security tools from.

# Management’s discussion and analysis

# Overview

Infosys is a leading provider of consulting, technology, outsourcing and next-generation digital services, enabling clients to create and execute strategies for their digital transformation and AI journey. Our purpose is to amplify human potential and create the next opportunity for people, business and communities. We are guided by our value system which motivates our attitudes and actions. Our core values are Client value, Leadership by example, Integrity and transparency, Fairness, and Excellence (C-LIFE).

Our strategic objective is to build a sustainable organization that remains relevant to the agenda of our clients, while creating growth opportunities for our employees, generating profitable growth for our investors and contributing to the communities that we operate in. There are numerous risks and challenges affecting our business. These are discussed in the Risk management report section of the Integrated Annual Report.

The challenge of having to reinvent their processes and systems rapidly in the AI era needs an understanding of new technologies and new ways of working, and also appreciation of AI landscapes, business processes and practices. Our strategy is to be a navigator for our clients as they ideate, plan and execute on their journey to an AI future by building strong data foundations with robust cloud capabilities. We are progressing well on our journey to leverage AI to deliver business value with safeguards around privacy, ethics, and controls.

# Our strengths

We believe that we are well-positioned for the principal competitive factors in our business. With more than four decades of experience in managing the systems and workings of global enterprises, we believe we are uniquely positioned to help them steer through their AI transformation as we have built our own AI-first strategy and continue to invest in strengthening our AI capabilities.

# I. Industry structure and developments

Fiscal 2025 saw uncertainties related to interest rates, geopolitical conditions and elections across major economies compounding the ongoing transformation within the Tech services industry. The year has been another year of major uncertainties in the economy, some geopolitical flux, and novel concerns around protectionism led disruption of global balances. The high inflation and interest rates are driving down discretionary spending. The year has been a year of subdued growth, pockets of economic green shoots that have kept technology-led growth active. AI has unified perspectives of the industry as well as government across geographies and sectors alike.

Global GDP is estimated to have grown at 3.2% in CY 20241, down 10bps compared to the previous year. The IT services growth during the same period has remained flat at 4.7%2. We expect client spending and investments to continue to move towards AI in the near term. These investments are expected to be crucial during this period of economic uncertainty. The dynamism in technologies continues and the industry is feeling the pressure to build AI strategies and stay ahead. We saw AI starting to reshape the industry in fiscal 2025. We continued to witness businesses attempting to reimagine their cost structures, increase business resilience and agility, personalize experiences for customers and employees, and launch new and disruptive products and services, aided by enterprise AI. With our leadership position in AI, we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of these market opportunities.

# 1. Revenue

The growth in our revenues in fiscal 2025 from fiscal 2024 is as follows:

| Particulars |          | Standalone |          | Consolidated |          |          |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------- | -------- | ------------ | -------- | -------- |
|             | 2025     | 2024       | % change | 2025         | 2024     | % change |
| Revenue     | 1,36,592 | 1,28,933   | 5.9      | 1,62,990     | 1,53,670 | 6.1      |

The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in realization on account of Value-Based Selling, productivity benefit from Lean and Automation, currency, acquisition and revenue mix partially offset by decline in volume. Revenue growth in reported terms includes the impact of currency fluctuations. We, therefore, additionally report the revenue growth in constant currency terms, which represents the real growth in revenue, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations. We calculate constant currency growth by comparing current-period revenues in respective local currencies converted to USD using prior-period exchange rates and comparing the same to our prior-period reported revenues. Our revenues in reported currency terms for fiscal 2025 is ₹1,62,990 crore, a growth of 6.1%. Our revenues for fiscal 2025 in constant currency grew by 4.2%. We added 365 new customers (gross) during fiscal 2025 as compared to 385 new customers (gross) during fiscal 2024. On a consolidated basis, for the year ended March 31, 2025, approximately 96.9% were export revenues whereas 3.1% were domestic revenues, while for the year ended March 31, 2024, 97.5% were export revenues whereas 2.5% were domestic revenues. Refer to the ‘Segmental profitability’ section in this report for more details on the analysis of segment revenues.

# 2. Expenditure

# Cost of sales

The cost of sales have decreased as a percentage of revenue by 0.2% on standalone basis and by 0.4% on consolidated basis in fiscal 2025 over fiscal 2024. The cost of efforts, comprising employee cost and cost of technical sub-contractors, has decreased as a percentage of revenue from 60.2% in fiscal 2024 to 58.8% in fiscal 2025 on a standalone basis, and from 56.4% in fiscal 2024 to 55.4% in fiscal 2025 on a consolidated basis. The cost of efforts as a percentage of revenue has decreased mainly on account of improved onsite mix, utilization and increase in third-party costs. Third-party items bought for service delivery to clients include software and hardware, which are integral to our overall service delivery to clients.

# Selling and marketing expenses

The selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue on standalone basis and consolidated basis have increased by 0.2% in fiscal 2025 over fiscal 2024.




# Management’s discussion and analysis

# General and administration expenses

The general and administration expenses as a percentage of revenue on standalone and consolidated basis have decreased by 0.3% and 0.2% respectively in fiscal 2025 over fiscal 2024. Contribution towards Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) on standalone basis is ₹540 crore and ₹492 crore for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. On consolidated basis is ₹585 crore and ₹533 crore for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.

# 3. Other income and finance cost

Other income primarily includes income from investments, gain / loss on investments, foreign exchange gain / loss on forward and options contracts, foreign exchange gain / loss on translation of other assets and liabilities and interest on income tax refund. Other income for fiscal 2025 includes interest (pre-tax) on income tax refund of ₹327 crore on account of orders received under Sections 250 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, from the income tax authorities in India for certain assessment years. Other income for fiscal 2024 includes interest (pre-tax) on income tax refund of ₹1,933 crore on account of orders received under Sections 250 and 254 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, from the income tax authorities in India for certain assessment years. In fiscal 2025, the Company received ₹1,522 crore of dividend from our subsidiaries, which is reflected in the Standalone financial statement. Interest income in fiscal 2025 has increased as compared to fiscal 2024 primarily due to increase in investible base and increase in yield on investments. We use foreign exchange forward and options contracts to hedge our exposure against movements in foreign exchange rates. Finance cost is on account of leases. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of these leases.

Our effective tax rate in fiscal 2024 was lower primarily on account of reversal of tax provision due to receipt of order giving effects in fiscal 2024 for prior assessment years. Effective tax rate is generally influenced by various factors including non-deductible expenses, exempt non-operating income, overseas taxes, tax reversals and provisions pertaining to prior periods, changes to tax regulations and other tax deductions. Tax reversals and provisions pertaining to prior periods are primarily on account of adjudication of certain disputed matters, upon filing of tax return and completion of assessments, across various jurisdictions.

During the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company received orders under Section 250 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, from the Income Tax Authorities in India for the assessment years, 2016-17 and 2019-20. These orders confirmed the Company's position with respect to tax treatment of certain contentious matters. As a result interest income (pre-tax) of ₹327 crore was recognised and provision for income tax aggregating ₹183 crore was reversed with a corresponding credit to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Also, upon resolution of the disputes, an amount aggregating to ₹1,068 crore has been reduced from contingent liabilities.

During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company received orders under Sections 250 and 254 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, from the Income Tax Authorities in India for the assessment years, 2007-08 to 2015-16, 2017-18 and 2018-19. These orders confirmed the Company's position with respect to tax treatment of certain contentious matters. As a result interest income (pre-tax) of ₹1,933 crore was recognised and provision for income tax aggregating ₹525 crore was reversed with a corresponding credit to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Also, upon resolution of the disputes, an amount aggregating to ₹1,628 crore has been reduced from contingent liabilities.

# 4. Provision for tax

We have provided for our tax liability both in India and overseas. The Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019 has introduced Section 115BAA wherein a domestic company can exercise option for a reduced rate of corporate tax without claim of certain deductions mentioned therein including deduction for SEZ units under Section 10AA of the Income-tax Act, 1961. For the fiscal 2025, the income tax expense of the Company has been recognized by applying the provision of Section 115BAA of the Income-tax Act without claim of deduction for SEZ units under Section 10AA of the Income-tax Act.

Overall segment profitability has increased primarily on account of an increase in foreign currency translation benefits, benefit from Project Maximus arising from Value-Based Selling, and Lean and Automation, improved utilization, and an insurance claim receivable relating to a cyber event pertaining to fiscal 2024, partially offset by higher employee compensation, higher cost of third-party items bought for service delivery to clients and acquisition impact. These have been discussed in detail in Note 2.24 to the Standalone financial statements in this Integrated Annual Report.

# V. Outlook, Risks and Concerns

We have adopted an integrated ERM framework that is implemented across the organization by the risk management office. Our ERM framework is developed by incorporating the best practices based on COSO and ISO 31000 and then tailored to suit our unique business requirements.

We have provided the details of Infosys ERM framework, key and emerging risks along with mitigation in the Risk management report of this Integrated Annual Report. The list of risk factors which we track for our business are covered in our 20-F filing available at https://www.infosys.com/investors/reports-filings/annual-report/annual-reports.html.

# VI. Internal Financial Control Systems and Their Adequacy

Infosys has aligned its current systems of internal financial control with the requirement of Companies Act, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Internal Control – Integrated Framework (the 2013 framework) is intended to increase transparency and accountability in an organization’s process of designing and implementing a system of internal control. The framework requires a company to identify and analyze risks and manage appropriate responses.

Internal financial control systems include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that are operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company’s policies, safeguarding of its assets, prevention and detection of frauds and errors, accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.

# Return on Net Worth

The details of return on net worth at standalone and consolidated levels are as follows:

| Particulars             | Standalone 2025 | Standalone 2024 | Consolidated 2025 | Consolidated 2024 |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Return on net worth (%) | 30.3            | 36.6            | 29.0              | 32.1              |

Return on net worth is computed as net profit by average net worth. Net profit increased from ₹26,233 crore to ₹26,713 crore on a consolidated basis and decreased from ₹27,234 crore to ₹25,568 crore on a standalone basis. Average net worth has increased in line with the net profit increase adjusted for dividends and buyback.

In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, the Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Integrated Annual Report, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in filings and submissions, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified, and that material information related to us and our consolidated subsidiaries is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions about required disclosure.

# Board meetings

Scheduling and selection of agenda items for Board meetings

The tentative dates of Board meetings for the next fiscal are decided in advance and published in the Integrated Annual Report. The Chairman and the Company Secretary, in consultation with the CEO &#x26; MD, and lead independent director propose the agenda for each meeting. The agenda, along with explanatory notes is circulated to the directors in advance to facilitate informed deliberation and decision making. Every Board member can suggest the inclusion of additional items in the agenda.

The Board meets at least once a quarter to review the quarterly results and other items on the agenda. Additional meetings are held when necessary. Independent directors are expected to attend at least four quarterly Board meetings and the Annual General Meeting (AGM). However, with the Board being represented by independent directors from various parts of the world, it may not be possible for all of them to be physically present at all meetings. Hence, we provide video / teleconferencing facilities to enable their participation.

The Board members are expected to rigorously prepare, attend and participate in the Board and applicable committee meetings. Each member is expected to ensure their other commitments do not materially interfere with their responsibilities towards the Company.

# Meeting of independent directors

For the Board to exercise free and fair judgment in all matters related to the functioning of the Company as well as the Board, it is important for the independent directors to have meetings without the presence of the executive management.

Schedule IV of the Companies Act, 2013 and the Rules thereunder mandate that the independent directors of the Company shall hold at least one meeting in a financial year, without the attendance of non-independent directors and members of the Management. Even before the Companies Act, 2013 came into effect, our Board’s process mandated periodic meetings attended exclusively by the independent directors.

During the year, the independent directors met four times without the presence of executive directors and management. At such meetings, the independent directors discuss, among other matters, the performance of the Company and risks faced by it, the flow of information to the Board, competition, strategy, leadership strengths and weaknesses, governance, compliance, Board movements, succession planning, human resources matters and the performance of the executive members of the Board, committees and the Chairman.

Fairness and excellence

# Fairness and excellence

Two of the core values of our C-LIFE, fairness and excellence are evident in the workings of the Board, its evaluation and the compensation paid to the directors and the executive leadership.

# Board member evaluation

One of the key functions of the Board is to monitor and review the Board evaluation framework. The Board works with the Nomination and Remuneration Committee to lay down the evaluation criteria for the performance of the Chairman, the Board, Board committees, and executive / non-executive / independent directors through peer evaluation, excluding the director being evaluated.

Independent directors have three key roles – governance, control and guidance. Some performance indicators, based on which the independent directors are evaluated, include:

- The ability to contribute to and monitor our corporate governance practices
- The ability to contribute by introducing international best practices to address business challenges and risks
- Active participation in long-term strategic planning
- Commitment to the fulfilment of a director’s obligations and fiduciary responsibilities; these include participation in Board and committee meetings.

# Board and executive leadership compensation

# Executive leadership compensation

Our executive compensation programs encourage reward for performance. A significant portion of the executives’ total rewards is tied to the delivery of long-term corporate performance goals to align with the interests of the shareholders.

As required under the Listing Regulations, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee recommends to the Board the payment of remuneration to the directors, KMP, and senior management. The Nomination and Remuneration Policy of the Company is available on our website, at Nomination and Remuneration Policy.

# Non-executive and non-independent chairman’s compensation

Nandan M. Nilekani, Chairman, voluntarily chose not to receive any remuneration for his services rendered to the Company.

# Independent directors’ compensation

The compensation payable to the independent directors is limited to a fixed amount per year as determined and approved by the Board, the sum of which does not exceed 1% of net profit for the year, calculated as per the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013. The Board reviews the performance of independent directors on an annual basis.

The Board, while deciding the basis for determining the compensation of the independent directors, takes various things into consideration. These include global board compensation benchmarking, participation of individual directors in Board and committee meetings, other responsibilities, such as membership or chairmanship of committees, time spent in carrying out other duties, roles and functions as prescribed in Schedule IV of the Companies Act, 2013, Listing Regulations and such other factors as the Board deems fit.

Shareholders at the 34ᵗʰ AGM held on June 22, 2015 approved a sum not exceeding 1% of the net profit of the Company per annum, calculated in accordance with the provisions of Section 198 of the Companies Act, 2013, to be paid and distributed among some or all of the non-executive directors of the Company in a manner decided by the Board. This payment will be made with respect to the profits of the Company for each year.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 133

Corporate governance report

The amount payable to the independent directors for the year ended March 31, 2025 is `17.68 crore. Additionally, independent directors are also reimbursed for expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties. We confirm that none of the non-executive directors received remuneration amounting to 50% of the total remuneration paid to non-executive directors during the year ended March 31, 2025.

# The aggregate amount of remuneration (commission) was arrived at using the following criteria:

| Particulars                         | in \` crore | in US$  |        |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------- | ------- | ------ |
| Fixed Board fee                     | 1.28        | 150,000 |        |
| Board / committee attendance fee(1) | 0.21        | 25,000  |        |
| Non-executive chairman fee          | 2.56        | 300,000 |        |
| Chairperson – Audit Committee       | 0.43        | 50,000  |        |
| Members – Audit Committee           | 0.26        | 30,000  |        |
| Chairperson – other committees      | 0.26        | 30,000  |        |
| Members – other committees          |             | 0.17    | 20,000 |
| Travel fee (per meeting)(2)         | 0.09        | 10,000  |        |
| Incidental fees (per meeting)(3)    | 0.01        | 1,000   |        |
| Lead Independent Director           |             | 0.26    | 30,000 |

Notes: 1 US$ = `85.48 as on March 31, 2025. The payment is subject to deduction of tax at source (TDS) as required by applicable tax laws.

(1) The Company normally has five regular Board meetings in a year. Independent directors are expected to attend at least four quarterly Board meetings and the AGM.

(2) For directors based overseas, the travel fee shown is per Board meeting. This is based on the fact that additional travel time of two days will have to be accommodated for independent directors to attend Board meetings in India.

(3) For directors based overseas, incidental fees shown is per Board meeting. This fee is paid to independent directors for expenses incurred during their travel to attend Board meetings in India.

The Board believes that the above compensation structure is commensurate with global best practices in terms of remunerating non-executive / independent directors of a company of similar size, and adequately compensates for the time and contribution made by our non-executive / independent directors.

# Indemnification agreements

We have also entered into agreements to indemnify our directors and officers for claims brought against them to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. These agreements, among other things, indemnify our directors and officers for certain expenses, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any such person in any action or proceedings, including any action by or in the right of the Company, arising out of such persons’ services as our director or officer, expenses in relation to public relations consultation, if required.

# Materially significant related party transactions

There have been no materially significant related party transactions that may have potential conflict with the interests of the listed entity at large as provided in the Related Party Transactions Policy, which is available on our website, at https://www.infosys.com/investors/corporate-governance/Documents/related-party-transaction-policy.pdf.

The details of these transactions are available at https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachHis/e0a622f0-71e9-4868-836f-ec073491004e.pdf.

# Integrity and transparency &#x26; Relationship with stakeholders

Our Company upholds integrity and transparency in all transactions and communications with stakeholders. Our stakeholders are our partners in our journey to sustained value creation and therefore, our relationship with stakeholders and clear communication with them is at the center of all disclosures and reports.

# Corporate

Infosys was incorporated in Pune, in 1981, as Infosys Consultants Private Limited, a private limited company under the Companies Act, 1956. In 1983, the corporate headquarters were relocated to Bengaluru. The name of the Company was changed to Infosys Technologies Private Limited in April 1992 and to Infosys Technologies Limited in June 1992, when the Company became a public limited company. We made an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in February 1993 and were listed on stock exchanges in India in June 1993. Trading opened at ₹145 per share, compared to the IPO price of ₹95 per share. In October 1994, we made a private placement of 5,50,000 shares at ₹450 each to Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), Financial Institutions (FIs) and body corporates. On March 11, 1999, Infosys listed on NASDAQ, becoming the first Indian company to do so. We issued 20,70,000 American Depositary Shares (ADSs) (equivalent to 10,35,000 equity shares of par value ₹10 each) at US$34 per ADS under the ADS Program, and these ADSs were listed on the NASDAQ National Market.

The share data mentioned before is unadjusted for stock split and bonus shares. In July 2003, June 2005 and November 2006, we issued secondary-sponsored American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) of US$294 million, US$1.1 billion and US$1.6 billion, respectively. During fiscal 2012, the name of the Company was changed from Infosys Technologies Limited to Infosys Limited to mark the transition from being a technology services provider to a business transformation partner to our clients.

During fiscal 2013, we delisted our ADSs from NASDAQ, and listed them in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Euronext London and Euronext Paris. During fiscal 2019, the Company voluntarily delisted from Euronext London and Paris due to low trading volume. Infosys equity shares and ADSs are listed on NSE and BSE in India and in NYSE, respectively, under the symbol “INFY”.

Note: The above graph depicts the increase in the number of Infosys shares as a result of the Company’s bonus issues over the years and a stock split in 2000 in the ratio of 2:1. For example, if the investor / shareholder held one share in 1986 prior to the bonus issue and continued to hold it, he would have 16,384 shares today owing to the bonus share issues and stock split.

# Risk management report

“Risks related to the geo-political changes, uncertainties in the economy, supply chain constraints, evolving regulations, technology disruption and cyber security have impacted businesses across the world during the fiscal year. Our enterprise risk management processes were instrumental in keeping the Company focused on our most important priorities toward all our stakeholders.”

Deepak Bhalla
EVP – Chief Risk Officer

Note: The risk-related information outlined in this section may not be exhaustive. The discussion may contain statements that are forward looking in nature. Our business is subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward looking statements. If any of the risks materializes, our business, financial conditions or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Our business, operating results, financial performance, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. Readers are advised to refer to the detailed discussion of risk factors and related disclosures in our regulatory filings and exercise their own judgment in assessing risks associated with the Company.

Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function enables the achievement of the Company’s strategic objectives by identifying, analyzing, assessing, mitigating, monitoring, and governing any risk or potential threat to these objectives. While this is the key driver, our values, culture, and commitment to stakeholders – employees, customers, investors, regulatory bodies, partners, and the community around us – are the foundation for our ERM framework. The systematic and proactive identification of risks, and mitigation thereof, enables our organization to boost performance with effective and timely decision-making. Strategic decisions are taken after careful consideration of primary risks, secondary risks, consequential risks, and residual risks. The ERM function also enables effective resource allocation through structured qualitative and quantitative risk impact assessment and prioritization based on our risk appetite, which is defined through the ERM framework. During the assessment, impacts and likelihood or probability of the risks are assessed using a four-point scale, and risks are categorized into four groups based on this. Our ERM framework also enables the identification of underlying opportunities during risk assessment, which are then further evaluated and actionized by the business. Our ERM framework encompasses all of the Company’s risks – strategy and strategy execution; operational; legal and compliance risks. Any of these categories can have internal or external dimensions. Hence, appropriate risk indicators are used to identify these risks proactively. We take cognizance of risks emanating internally or externally and their cumulative impact while framing our risk responses.

# Emerging risks

Our ERM framework has defined a process to identify, assess, plan, and monitor risks emerging from internal and external environment which enables the Company to build and maintain resilience in uncertain times. The process includes horizon scanning and SWOT analysis, which cover political, economic, social, technology, legal and environmental aspects. The emerging risks are monitored constantly and discussed in the risk councils and with the Risk Management Committee (RMC) of the Board on a periodic basis.

# Risk Categories

| **Strategy and strategy execution** | The risks arising out of the choices we have made in defining our strategy and the risks to the successful execution of our strategy are covered in this category. For example, risks inherent to our industry and our competitiveness are analyzed and mitigated through strategic choices of target markets, our market offerings, business model and talent base.                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Operational**                     | The risks affecting our policies, procedures, people and systems, thereby impacting service delivery or operations, or compromising our core values or business practices are covered in this category. For example, risks such as inefficiencies in internal processes, human rights, fraud risks, business activity disruptions due to natural calamities, climate change events, human conflicts, system failures and cybersecurity attacks. |
| **Legal and compliance**            | The risks arising out of threats posed to our financial, organizational, or reputational standing resulting from litigations, non-conformance with laws, regulatory or geo-political developments, codes of conduct and contractual compliances are covered in this category.                                                                                                                                                                   |

# Integrated Enterprise Risk Management Framework

We have adopted an integrated ERM framework that is implemented across the organization by the risk management office. Our ERM framework is developed by incorporating the best practices based on COSO and ISO 31000 and then tailored to suit our unique business requirements.

Risk management at Infosys encompasses all areas, including first, second, and third lines of defence. Risk management is embedded into the core business process and day-to-day decision making of every function within the Company and forms an integral part of the development process and project execution. Risk management has been ingrained into the job description of senior management, middle management, and people who front-end the customer work. Achieving strategic goals by proactively managing the risks is the responsibility of the Company’s management at all levels. Financial incentives are linked to the achievement of strategic goals. As the first line of defence, they evaluate risks and opportunities before taking key business decisions. This first line works closely with corporate ERM through risk councils and sub-risk councils created across the organization in different units.

The second line of defence consists of various risk functions such as Information Security Group (ISG), Data Privacy Office (DPO), Quality, Delivery Risk Management (DRM), Business Continuity, Legal, Compliance, etc., who work very closely with ERM function in identifying, assessing, reporting and governing the risks. While risks are largely mitigated by the first line / business, they are tracked and governed by the second line. These are reported to the executive leadership through various councils, including the Operational Risk Council (ORC) and the Legal &#x26; Compliance Risk Council (LCRC). These key risks are also presented to the Risk Management Committee (RMC) of the Board on a quarterly basis.

The third line of defence encompasses an internal audit that reviews various risks and controls on a periodic basis to assess the effectiveness of the risk management process and report independently. Inputs on key risks by the ERM are considered while drafting the audit plan. The Company maintains a single hierarchical risks repository from L1 to L5, covering strategic to tactical risks. All these are governed by the integrated ERM framework of the Company. This is how all lines of defence are aligned as depicted in the ERM framework above.

The Company also conducts maturity assessment of the ERM process on a periodic basis by an independent external agency. The recent maturity assessment was conducted in March 2024.

Risk management is ingrained in all parts of the organization. Risk-enabled decision-making and forums at various levels of the organization to enhance risk-related decisions to identify and mitigate the risks are the hallmarks of a good risk culture. At Infosys, this is enabled through the implementation of integrated Enterprise Risk Management, and this function acts as a decision support system for the executive leadership. A multi-layered governance structure provides open forums for risk discussions at various levels. Comprehensive awareness and training programs are conducted on a regular basis for all the employees and contractors to cover risks applicable to the business. Lex, our in-house learning platform, offers various risk management courses which are accessible from anywhere in the world. Periodic table-top exercises are conducted in key areas to review preparedness for high impact-low probability risks.

Salient features of our Enterprise Risk Management program
Our ERM program adopts unique methods to identify risks, evaluate potential impact and promote risk awareness across the organization.

# Secondary, consequential and residual risks

Secondary risks are threats that could impede the mitigation of primary risks. Consequential risks are the unintended consequences of primary mitigation, and residual risks are those risks that are left over after mitigation.

# Enterprise Risk Management program

Exposure for same risks are aggregated as it goes up the hierarchy. This provides enterprise-wide view to the leadership. Cumulated risk view is also provided to understand total exposure arising out of all risks at a unit level.

# Process risk frameworks

Process-specific risk frameworks have been developed for decision-making, for example, frameworks for customer risk, vendor risk, contractual liability, contractual weighted risk and credit risk.

# Intelligent risk analytics

Internal and external risk and performance indicators, and loss incidents are used in real time to identify, analyze and assess potential issues that could negatively impact strategic goals.

# RISC360 : iGRC

RISC360 is the Company’s Governance, Risk management and Compliance (GRC) program that combines three lines of defense under one umbrella. This enables risk-based decision-making and auditing. The Company has implemented a technology platform, iGRC, to provide a consolidated view of risks to strategic goals.

# Risk culture

Our risk culture encourages open and upward communication. Coupled with our belief systems and core values, this drives behavior, guides daily activities and decision-making throughout the organization. We encourage sharing of knowledge and best practices, continuous process improvement and a strong commitment to ethics and integrity.

# Highlights of fiscal 2025

During fiscal 2025, various risks management initiatives were undertaken so as to ensure the smooth delivery of services to our clients, transparent communication with all stakeholders, fulfilment of our social responsibility while ensuring employee safety and health by strengthening risk management program and enhancing the risk culture. The risk office assessed, monitored and reported on risks related to geo-political scenarios; uncertainties in the economy; inflation; technology disruption and innovation; talent availability; cybersecurity; data protection and privacy; ESG; contractual liabilities; and complex and evolving regulatory environment.

While the Company tracks several risks to its business, the key risks and emerging risks are described below along with the Company’s approach to mitigate them.

| Geo-political, macroeconomic or health events | * Our revenues are concentrated in a few geographies and client industries, and a large part of our revenue is dependent on a limited number of clients. Unfavorable geo-political, economic, or health events may result in currency volatility and reduced spend on technology products and services which may adversely impact demand for our offerings which in turn may impact our growth and profitability.
* Emerging risk aspect: Geo-political, economic or health events are dynamic in nature and constantly evolving. Uncertainty and unpredictability of policy changes by governments such as tariffs, trade restrictions etc., sometimes make it difficult to predict and assess the impact. | - Broad-based growth to reduce concentration in any single region, client or industry
- Monitor geo-political and macroeconomic scenarios, identify potential business impact and implement additional controls to build operational agility to respond to situations
- Implement currency hedging best practices to minimize the impact due to the volatility
- Implement strong business continuity protocols in the regions affected by the geo-political conflicts
- Hybrid working model to address evolving geo-political risks

# Cybersecurity risk management

Cyber risks, being one of the key risks, is managed through multi-layered controls with a defence-in-depth approach starting from the cybersecurity strategy, supplemented by policies, processes and controls (preventive, detective, and corrective). Our strategy is focused on four areas: transparency and experience; continual improvement and compliance; cyber resilience; and building and maintaining a positive cybersecurity culture within the organization. A high-level working group, the enterprise Information Security Council (ISC), has been established, which is responsible for governing and overseeing the Information Security Management System (ISMS) at Infosys. ISC focuses on establishing, directing, monitoring, and executing the information security program with representation from various departments and business units at Infosys and reports to the Operational Risk Council highlighting key risks to the executive leadership.

This engagement was conducted by a multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners, environmental engineers and specialists.
2. Identified Sustainability Information

Our scope of reasonable assurance consists of the BRSR Core indicators listed in the Appendix I to our report. The reporting boundary of the Report is as disclosed in Question 13 of Section A: General Disclosure of the BRSR with exceptions disclosed by way of note under respective questions of the BRSR, where applicable.
3. Criteria

The Criteria used by the Company to prepare the Identified Sustainability Information is as under:
- Regulation 34(2)(f) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (the “SEBI”) (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements), Regulations, 2015 as amended;

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25 155




# 7. Our Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance opinion on the Identified Sustainability Information listed in Appendix I based on the procedures we have performed and evidence we have obtained.

We conducted our engagement in accordance with the Standard on Sustainability Assurance Engagements (SSAE) 3000, “Assurance Engagements on Sustainability Information”, and Standard on Assurance Engagements (SAE) 3410 “Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements” (together the “Standards”), both issued by the Sustainability Reporting Standards Board (the “SRSB”) of the ICAI.

These standards require that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Identified Sustainability Information listed in Appendix I and included in the Report are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria.

As part of a reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with the Standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the engagement.

# 8. Reasonable Assurance

A reasonable assurance engagement involves identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances. The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of processes performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting policies, analytical procedures and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.

Given the circumstances of the engagement, in performing the procedures listed above, we:

- Obtained an understanding of the Identified Sustainability Information and related disclosures;
- Obtained an understanding of the assessment criteria and their suitability for the evaluation and/or measurements of the Identified Sustainability Information;
- Made inquiries of Company’s management, including environment team, compliance team, human resource team amongst others and those with the responsibility for preparation of the Report;
- Obtained an understanding and performed an evaluation of the design of the key systems, processes and controls for recording, processing and reporting on the Identified Sustainability Information at the corporate office and at other locations/offices on a sample basis. This included evaluating the design of those controls relevant to the engagement and determining whether they have been implemented by performing procedures in addition to inquiry of the personnel responsible for the Identified Sustainability Information;
- Based on the above understanding and the risks that the Identified Sustainability Information may be materially misstated, determined the nature, timing and extent of further procedures;
- Tested the key assumptions, emission factors and methodologies used for calculation of the Greenhouse Gas (the “GHG”) emissions;
- Tested the Company’s process for collating the sustainability information through agreeing or reconciling the identified sustainability Information with the underlying records on a sample basis; and
- Tested the consolidation for locations/offices on a sample basis and corporate office under the reporting boundary for ensuring the completeness of data being reported.

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable assurance opinion.

# 9. Exclusions

Our assurance scope excludes the following and therefore we do not express an opinion on:

- Aspects of the Report and the data/information (qualitative or quantitative) other than the Identified Sustainability Information; and
- The statements that describe expression of opinion, belief, aspiration, expectation, aim, or future intentions provided by the Company.

# 10. Other information

The Company’s management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included within the BRSR, the IAR and the Environment Social and Governance (the “ESG”) Report, other than Identified Sustainability Information and our independent assurance reports dated May 31, 2025, thereon.



Our opinion on the Identified Sustainability Information does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our assurance engagement of the Identified Sustainability Information, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Identified Sustainability Information or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# 11. Reasonable Assurance Opinion

Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, the BRSR Core indicators for the year ended March 31, 2025, listed in Appendix I are prepared in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria as stated in paragraph 3 above.

# 12. Restriction on use

Our Reasonable Assurance report has been prepared and addressed to the Board of Directors of the Company at the request of the Company solely, to assist the Company in reporting on Company’s sustainability performance and activities. Accordingly, we accept no liability to anyone, other than the Company. Our Reasonable Assurance report should not be used for any other purpose or by any person other than the addressees of our report. We neither accept nor assume any duty of care or liability for any other purpose or to any other party to whom our report is shown or into whose hands it may come without our prior consent in writing.

# Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report

Infosys has always placed sustainability at the heart of its business approach. Our ability to fulfill and exceed our responsibilities to our stakeholders is a testament to our commitment. We have balanced our business success with an unwavering focus on exemplary corporate governance and responsiveness to the needs of the environment and society. As an early proponent of responsible business, we readily embraced our commitment to integrate Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors into our operations. We adopted the GRI Framework in 2008 and in fiscal 2013, we were among the first companies to publish the Business Responsibility Report (BRR).

The BRSR follows the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC) principles on the social, environmental and economic responsibilities of business. Our BRSR includes our responses to questions about our practices and performance on key principles defined by Regulation 34(2)(f) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015 as amended from time to time, which cover topics across all ESG dimensions.

# 10. Health and safety management system:

# 10a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes / No). If yes, the coverage of such system?

Yes. Infosys recognizes and accords highest priority to safety and well-being of its employees and other relevant parties. Our HSE Policy enunciates our philosophy and commitment towards the management of key Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) aspects. In line with our strategy, our Health, Safety and Environmental Management System (HSEMS) at all India locations is certified to ISO 45001:2018 standard. HSEMS is implemented at all our overseas locations based on legal requirements / internal benchmarks and have also included them in the internal audits cycle. We have established numerous interventions to address occupational health-related topics such as emotional well-being, mental health, ergonomics, safety, lifestyle diseases and more. Well-equipped occupational health centers are available at all our campuses in India. During the year, doctors and physiotherapists have helped employees and their families through virtual consultations leveraging our telemedicine portal. More details on Occupational Health and Safety are available on our website at https://www.infosys.com/about/corporate-responsibility/social/employee-wellbeing/occupational-health-safety.html.

# 10b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity?

We proactively identify occupational health and safety risks, for all existing / new / modified activities, processes, products or services, and regulatory changes, including routine and non-routine activities. Risk assessment includes quarterly evaluation of incidents that have occurred. Hazardous conditions, if any, are identified and prioritized for elimination and control. Once the identified hierarchy of controls is implemented, the risk assessment is revisited to assess the residual risks. As Infosys is an IT / ITES company, there are no product risks, but there are risks associated with the provision of services such as ergonomics at work and those associated with the operation of utilities and employees’ commute. Participation and consultation with relevant personnel involved in the activities is ensured during the risk assessments. Risks are also assessed before and after the development of new buildings. Experience from previous projects and ongoing operations is also considered. We continually monitor our construction sites where infrastructure is being built. More details on Occupational Health and Safety are available on our website at https://www.infosys.com/about/corporate-responsibility/social/employee-wellbeing/occupational-health-safety.html.

# 10c. Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y / N)

Yes. We have a process for employees and ‘other than permanent’ employees to report work-related hazards.

# 10d. Do the employees/ worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services?

Yes

# 12. Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place.

Infosys acknowledges that Occupational Health and Safety (OH&#x26;S) is one of the key aspects of sustainable business practices. OH&#x26;S policies, processes, and practices at Infosys promote the physical, emotional, and social well-being of employees in the workplace. The robust Health and Safety Management system at Infosys has earned us the certification of ISO 45001:2018 for all Indian locations, including Infosys Limited and its subsidiaries, in line with our HSE strategy.

The Company has implemented the following measures to ensure a safe and healthy workplace:

1. Incident management: Incidents, which include near misses / potential hazards / accidents, are reported through internal applications or email. The causes of incidents are identified, analyzed and appropriate corrective actions are taken to prevent recurrence or occurrence of incidents leading to injuries / losses.
2. OH&#x26;S Committee: Both employees and contract workers are part of the Infosys OH&#x26;S Committee, which helps in ensuring their active participation and consultation.
3. Training and awareness: Training includes awareness building, mock drills, classroom sessions and periodic demonstrations. HSEMS training is a part of our employee induction program. To enable continuous learning, an HSE awareness module is available on Lex, our internal learning platform. For contract staff, job-specific and general training is provided during induction and later through refresher training.
4. Safety interventions: We have always focused on building a culture of safety at Infosys. The safety systems in place include work permits, trainings, Lock Out Tag Out (LOTO), safety inspections, audits, operational controls, and monitoring. Policies have been established focusing on specific areas such as women’s safety, lone working, transport, travel, construction and others.
5. Medical services: We have set up first aid centers on our campuses in India. Some of the first aid facilities are operational round the clock. Our telemedicine portal continues to operate and allows our employees to consult the doctors at our occupational health centers in India online. We have ambulance services available or have arrangements for ambulances to be made available at all our India-based locations.
6. Health Risk Assessment (HRA): HRA is conducted annually based on inputs from the OHC. Being an IT / ITES company, the prevalent risks include ergonomics, Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs), emotional well-being, etc., associated with the workplace, operation of utilities, and commute. Numerous initiatives, interventions, engagement virtual sessions, and process controls are in place to address these risks.

Infosys does not tolerate any form of retaliation (whether by a manager, co-worker or otherwise) against an individual because he or she made a good faith report of an integrity concern.

# 8. Does the entity have any project related to reducing greenhouse gas emission? If yes, provide details.

Infosys has been carbon neutral since fiscal 2020 across Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Our approach to carbon neutrality is based on reducing and avoiding emissions through energy efficiency and renewable energy. Energy efficiency is achieved through super-efficient new buildings, industry-leading Energy Performance Index (EPI) &#x3C;65 kWh/m2-yr, real-time monitoring and optimization of building operations through smart building systems, and retrofits in existing buildings. Infosys has implemented several retrofit projects (across air conditioning, lighting, and UPS systems) in the past and achieved a connected electrical load reduction of 36 MW across campuses in India. In 2025, we have undertaken a retrofit project to replace direct FCU units with chilled water units of air conditioning, which saved 1.3 lakh kWh and reduced emissions by 94.72 tCO₂e. To achieve our goal of transitioning to clean energy, we have installed 60 MW of solar PV capacity.

# 10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments.

Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.

The 5R principle –’ Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Refurbish / Repurpose and Recycle’ – forms the foundation of Infosys’ waste management strategy. Through our efforts, we turn waste into resources and thus support a circular economy. Infosys has adopted a comprehensive waste management practice which involves collection, sorting and disposal of waste. Waste management practices at Infosys include source segregation, secondary segregation, effective waste processing and collection, recycling and efficient disposal of all waste in accordance with relevant laws. This helps reduce negative impacts on the environment.

We seek to uphold our ambition of ‘zero waste to landfill’ through active minimization combined with technological investment in recycling and streamlining of systems and processes. Infosys is pursuing the goal of zero waste to landfill at all of its own sites by 2030, utilizing the TRUE Certification for Zero Waste, provided by Green Business Certification Inc. TRUE Certification requires a facility to divert at least 90% of its waste from landfill, incineration (waste-to-energy), and the environment. Using TRUE’s portfolio approach, Infosys has earned TRUE Certification for three campuses last year, and is committed to achieving certification for seven of its owned campuses in fiscal 2026 and subsequently will embark on the certification for the rest of the owned locations.

The e-waste is disposed to authorized refurbishers, recyclers who issue us certificates for successful recycling and recovery of the material. These are established with a focus on adhering to principles of circularity. Other hazardous waste such as biomedical waste, oil-soaked cotton, oil filters from DG sets, and other trash are designated by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB). These agencies incinerate the waste in compliance with the rules and regulations. The resulting ash is used in some places for the manufacture of cement and is sent for Treatment, Storage, Disposal Facility (TSDF) landfills for safe disposal.

# 5. Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.

Infosys has a Business Continuity Management System (BCMS) called Phoenix, certified by ISO 22301:2019 Security and Resilience – Business Continuity Management Standard. This program is designed to ensure seamless continuity of business and the utmost safety of our employees and assets while continuously meeting client expectations. The BCMS program provides a robust framework for planning, establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining, and continually improving business continuity measures across Infosys and its subsidiaries. Apart from Phoenix plan at the corporate level, comprehensive business continuity plans are created at three operational levels covering business functions, locations, and accounts. Integrated into our Enterprise Risk Management Framework, the BCMS plans guide our typical response to events, such as catastrophes and natural or human-made disasters, which could disrupt or severely constrain our operations. This covers various crisis scenarios as part of detailed risk assessments (at functions, locations, and accounts level), which are documented with mitigation plans along with controls put in place. The management system has been continuously validated across levels through tests and exercises, and various incidents have been successfully tackled without significant business continuity or employee safety impacts. An efficient business continuity management policy has enabled us to maintain status quo during disasters.

Independent Auditor’s Report

# To The Members Of Infosys Limited

# Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements

# Opinion

We have audited the accompanying Standalone Financial Statements of INFOSYS LIMITED (the “Company”), which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2025, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended on that date and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as the “Standalone Financial Statements”).

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian accounting standards prescribed under section 133 of the act, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2025 and its profit, total comprehensive income, changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

# Key Audit Matter

| Sr. No. | Key Audit Matter    |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| 1       | Revenue recognition |

The Company’s contracts with customers include contracts with multiple products and services. The Company derives revenues from IT services comprising software development and related services, maintenance, consulting and package implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Company’s core and digital offerings and business process management services. The Company assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables involves significant judgement.

In certain integrated services arrangements, contracts with customers include subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Company is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Company first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods or service before it is transferred to the customer. The Company considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or service, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the products or service and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.

Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on (1) a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Company’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.

As certain contracts with customers involve management’s judgment in (1) identifying distinct performance obligations, (2) determining whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition from these judgments were identified as a key audit matter and required a higher extent of audit effort. Refer Notes 1.4 and 2.18 to the Standalone Financial Statements.

# Auditor’s Response

Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following:

Our audit procedures related to the (1) identification of distinct performance obligations, (2) determination of whether the Company is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method included the following, among others:

- We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the (a) identification of distinct performance obligations, (b) determination of whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (c) determination of whether fixed price maintenance revenue for certain contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method.
- We selected a sample of contracts with customers and performed the following procedures:
- Obtained and read contract documents for each selection, including master service agreements, and other documents that were part of the agreement.
- Identified significant terms and deliverables in the contract to assess management’s conclusions regarding the (i) identification of distinct performance obligations (ii) whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (iii) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method.

# Key Audit Matter

| Sr. No. | Key Audit Matter                                                                      |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2       | Revenue recognition - Fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method |

Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either (1) on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from services rendered to the customer and the Company’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.

Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Company to determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.

We identified the estimate of total efforts or costs to complete fixed price contracts measured using the percentage of completion method as a key audit matter as the estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. This estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts or costs incurred to-date and estimates of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations over the term of the contracts.

This required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence and a higher extent of audit effort to evaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts.

Refer Notes 1.4 and 2.18 to the Standalone Financial Statements.

# Auditor’s Response

# Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following:

Our audit procedures related to estimates of total expected costs or efforts to complete for fixed-price contracts included the following, among others:

- We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to (1) recording of efforts or costs incurred and estimation of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations and (2) access and application controls pertaining to time recording, allocation and budgeting systems which prevents unauthorised changes to recording of efforts incurred.
- We selected a sample of fixed price contracts with customers measured using the percentage-of-completion method and performed the following:

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, including other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including Ind AS specified under section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, management and Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Company’s Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Standalone Financial Statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal financial controls that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The Company’s Management and Board of Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.

# Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements.

# Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements

A company's internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

# Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

# xvi.

On the basis of the financial ratios, ageing and expected dates of realisation of financial assets and payment of financial liabilities, other information accompanying the financial statements and our knowledge of the Board of Directors and Management plans and based on our examination of the evidence supporting the assumptions, nothing has come to our attention, which causes us to believe that any material uncertainty exists as on the date of the audit report indicating that Company is not capable of meeting its liabilities existing at the date of balance sheet as and when they fall due within a period of one year from the balance sheet date. We, however, state that this is not an assurance as to the future viability of the Company.

Statement of Cash Flows

# Accounting Policy

Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit for the year is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated. The Company considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash to be cash equivalents.

Infosys' strategy is to be a navigator for our clients as they ideate, plan and execute on their journey to a digital future.

The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in India and has its registered office at Electronics City, Hosur Road, Bengaluru 560100, Karnataka, India. The Company has its primary listings on the BSE Ltd. and National Stock Exchange of India Limited. The Company’s American Depositary Shares (ADS) representing equity shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

The Standalone financial statements are approved for issue by the Company's Board of Directors on April 17, 2025.

# 1.2 Basis of preparation of financial statements

These Standalone financial statements are prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (''the Act''), guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) under the historical cost convention on accrual basis except for certain financial instruments which are measured at fair values, defined benefit liability / (asset) which is recognized at the present value of defined benefit obligation less fair value of plan assets. The Ind AS are prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and relevant amendment rules issued thereafter.

Accounting policies have been consistently applied except where a newly-issued accounting standard is initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in the accounting policy hitherto in use. The material accounting policy information used in preparation of the audited condensed standalone interim financial statements have been discussed in the respective notes.

As the year to date figures are taken from the source and rounded to the nearest digits, the figures reported for the previous quarters might not always add up to the year to date figures reported in this statement.

# 1.3 Use of estimates and judgments

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the Management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and assumptions affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. The Company assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables, and allocation of transaction price to these distinct performance obligations involves significant judgement.

Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period. Revenue from fixed-price maintenance contract is recognized ratably using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and Company’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of the contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.

The Company uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for other fixed-price contracts. Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Company to determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information.

Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue

# 2. Notes to the Standalone financial statements

# 2.1 Property, plant and equipment

Accounting Policy

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Costs directly attributable to acquisition are capitalized until the property, plant and equipment are ready for use, as intended by the Management. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived at after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The Company depreciates property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:

| Building(1)               | 22-25 years                                     |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Plant and machinery(1)    | 5 years                                         |
| Office equipment          | 5 years                                         |
| Computer equipment(1)     | 3-5 years                                       |
| Furniture and fixtures(1) | 5 years                                         |
| Vehicles(1)               | 5 years                                         |
| Leasehold improvements    | Lower of useful life of the asset or lease term |

(1) Based on technical evaluation, the Management believes that the useful lives as given above best represent the period over which the Management expects to use these assets. Hence, the useful lives for these assets is different from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The useful lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology.

Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet date is classified as capital advances under other non-current assets and the cost of assets not ready to use before such date are disclosed under ‘Capital work-in-progress’. Subsequent expenditures relating to property, plant and equipment is capitalized only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with these will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the financial statements upon sale or retirement of the asset.

# Impairment

Property, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.



If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. An impairment loss is reversed in the Statement of Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of any accumulated depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.

# The changes in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment for the year ended March 31, 2025 are as follows:

# 2.2.2 Other intangible assets

# Accounting policy

Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Intangible assets are amortized over their respective individual estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset is based on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, and known technological advances), and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed periodically including at each financial year end.

Research costs are expensed as incurred. Software product development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and commercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future economic benefits are probable, the Company has an intention and ability to complete and use or sell the software and the costs can be measured reliably. The costs which can be capitalized include the cost of material, direct labor, overhead costs that are directly attributable to prepare the asset for its intended use.

The changes in the carrying value of acquired intangible assets for the year ended March 31, 2025 are as follows:

# 2.3 Leases

# Accounting policy

The Company as a lessee

The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for land, buildings and computers. The Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (i) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.

At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a Right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

As a lessee, the Company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. The Company makes an assessment on the expected lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Company considers factors such as any significant leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of the lease and the importance of the underlying asset to Infosys’s operations taking into account the location of the underlying asset and the availability of suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current economic circumstances.

Certain lease arrangements include the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.

The ROU assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

The ROU assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. The ROU assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.



The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Company changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash flows.

# The Company as a lessor

Leases for which the Company is a lessor is classified as a finance or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

When the Company is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the ROU asset arising from the head lease.

For operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

# Accounting policy

# 2.11.1 Initial recognition

The Company recognizes financial assets and financial liabilities when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities, which are not at fair value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial recognition. Regular way purchase and sale of financial assets are accounted for at trade date.

# 2.11.2 Subsequent measurement

a. Non-derivative financial instruments

(i) Financial assets carried at amortized cost

A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortized cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

(ii) Financial assets carried at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

A financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The Company has made an irrevocable election for its investments which are classified as equity instruments to present the subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income based on its business model.

(iii) Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above categories are subsequently fair valued through profit or loss.

(iv) Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method, except for contingent.

consideration recognized in a business combination which is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.

# 2.11 Investment in subsidiaries

Investment in subsidiaries is carried at cost in the separate financial statements.

# b. Derivative financial instruments

The Company holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for such contracts is generally a bank.

# (i) Financial assets or financial liabilities, carried at fair value through profit or loss.

This category includes derivative financial assets or liabilities which are not designated as hedges. Although the Company believes that these derivatives constitute hedges from an economic perspective, they may not qualify for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments. Any derivative that is either not designated as hedge, or is so designated but is ineffective as per Ind AS 109, is categorized as a financial asset or financial liability, at fair value through profit or loss.

Derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized initially at fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognized in net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss when incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, these derivatives are measured at fair value through profit or loss and the resulting exchange gains or losses are included in other income. Assets / liabilities in this category are presented as current assets / current liabilities if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realized within 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.

# (ii) Cash flow hedge

The Company designates certain foreign exchange forward and options contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecast cash transactions. When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized immediately in the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognized in cash flow hedging reserve till the period the hedge was effective remains in cash flow hedging reserve until the forecasted transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in the cash flow hedging reserve is transferred to the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss upon the occurrence of the related forecasted transaction. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified to net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

# 2.11.3 Derecognition of financial instruments

The Company derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109. A financial liability (or a part of a financial liability) is derecognized from the Company's Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.

# 2.11.4 Fair value of financial instruments

In determining the fair value of its financial instruments, the Company uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each reporting date. The methods used to determine fair value include discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing model, market multiples, available quoted market prices and dealer quotes. All methods of assessing fair value result in general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized.

Refer to table 'Financial instruments by category' below for the disclosure on carrying value and fair value of financial assets and liabilities. For financial assets and liabilities maturing within one year from the Balance Sheet date and which are not carried at fair value, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

# 2.11.5 Impairment

The Company recognizes loss allowances using the expected credit loss (ECL) model for the financial assets and unbilled revenues which are not fair valued through profit or loss. Loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues with no significant financing component is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition in which case those are measured at lifetime ECL.

The Company determines the allowance for credit losses based on historical loss experience adjusted to reflect current and estimated future economic conditions. The Company considers current and anticipated future economic conditions relating to industries the Company deals with and the countries where it operates.

The amount of ECLs (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date to the amount that is required to be recorded is recognized as an impairment loss or gain in Statement of Profit and Loss.

(1) On account of fair value changes including interest accrued

(2) Excludes interest accrued on tax-free bonds and government bonds carried at amortized cost of ₹84 crore

(3) Excludes unbilled revenue on contracts where the right to consideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones

For trade receivables, trade payables, other assets and payables maturing within one year from the Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate the fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

# Fair value hierarchy

- Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3 – Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

During the year ended March 31, 2024, tax-free bonds and non-convertible debentures of ₹1,986 crore were transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 of fair value hierarchy since these were valued based on quoted price. Further, State government securities of ₹73 crore were transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 of fair value hierarchy, since these were valued based on market observable inputs. A one percentage point change in the unobservable inputs used in fair valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities does not have a significant impact in its value.

Majority of investments of the Company are fair valued based on Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. These investments primarily include investment in liquid mutual fund units, target maturity fund units, tax-free bonds, certificates of deposit, commercial papers, treasury bills, government securities, non-convertible debentures, quoted bonds issued by government and quasi-government organizations. The Company invests after considering counterparty risks based on multiple criteria including Tier I capital, Capital Adequacy Ratio, Credit Rating, Profitability, NPA levels and Deposit base of banks and financial institutions. These risks are monitored regularly as per Group's risk management program.

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate foreign exchange related risk exposures. The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristic of each customer and the concentration of risk from the top few customers.

# Market risk

The Company operates internationally and a major portion of the business is transacted in several currencies and consequently the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its sales and services in the United States and elsewhere, and purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies.

# Financial risk management

# Financial risk factors

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's primary focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimize potential adverse effects on its financial performance. The primary market risk to the Company is foreign exchange risk. The Company holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the results of the Company’s operations are adversely affected as the rupee appreciates / depreciates against these currencies.

# Credit risk

Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by the counterparty resulting in a financial loss. The maximum exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily from trade receivables amounting to ₹26,437 crore and ₹25,152 crore as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively and unbilled revenue amounting to ₹11,988 crore and ₹10,814 crore as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Trade receivables and unbilled revenue are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue from customers majorly located in the United States of America and Europe. Credit risk has always been managed by the Company through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of the customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company uses the expected credit loss model to assess any required allowances; and uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues. This matrix takes into account credit reports and other related credit information to the extent available.

The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristic of each customer and the concentration of risk from the top few customers. Exposure to customers is diversified and there is no single customer contributing more than 10% of outstanding trade receivables and unbilled revenues. The following table gives details in respect of percentage of revenues generated from top five customers and top ten customers:

| Particulars                     | Year ended March 31, 2025 | Year ended March 31, 2024 |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Revenue from top five customers | 12.0                      | 11.6                      |
| Revenue from top ten customers  | 19.9                      | 18.9                      |

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited as the Company generally invests in deposits with banks with high ratings assigned by international and domestic credit rating agencies. Ratings are monitored periodically and the Company has considered the latest available credit ratings as at the date of approval of these financial statements.

The investments of the Company primarily include investment in liquid mutual fund units, target maturity fund units, tax-free bonds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, treasury bills, government securities, non-convertible debentures, quoted bonds issued by government and quasi government organizations. The Company invests after considering counterparty risks based on multiple criteria including Tier I Capital, Capital Adequacy Ratio, credit rating, profitability, NPA levels and deposit base of banks and financial institutions. These risks are monitored regularly as per Group’s risk management program.

# Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time. The Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and the cash flow that is generated from operations. The Company has no outstanding borrowings. The Company believes that the working capital is sufficient to meet its current requirements. As at March 31, 2025, the Company had a working capital of ₹45,406 crore including cash and cash equivalents of

As at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, 2,88,384 and 2,91,795 cash-settled options were outstanding respectively. The carrying value of liability towards cash-settled share-based payments was ₹8 crore and ₹13 crore as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 respectively.

The fair value of the awards are estimated using the Black-Scholes Model for time and non-market performance-based options and Monte Carlo simulation model is used for TSR-based options.

The inputs to the model include the share price at date of grant, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends, expected term and the risk free rate of interest. Expected volatility during the expected term of the options is based on historical volatility of the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the options. Expected volatility of the comparative company have been modelled based on historical movements in the market prices of their publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the options. Correlation coefficient is calculated between each peer entity and the indices as a whole or between each entity in the peer group.

The fair value of each equity-settled award is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:

# 2.16 Provisions

# Accounting policy

A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that is reasonably estimable, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The Company recognizes a reimbursement asset when, and only when, it is virtually certain that the reimbursement will be received if the Company settles the obligation.

# a. Post-sales client support

The Company provides its clients with a fixed-period post-sales support on its fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts. Costs associated with such support services are accrued at the time related revenues are recorded in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The Company estimates such costs based on historical experience and estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis for any material changes in assumptions and likelihood of occurrence.

# b. Onerous contracts

Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations under the contract. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognizes any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

| Particulars                       | As at March 31, 2025 |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------- |

| Balance at the end                | 993                  |

Provision for post-sales client support and other provisions majorly represents costs associated with providing sales support services which are accrued at the time of recognition of revenues and are expected to be utilized over a period of 1 year.

# 2.17 Income taxes

# Accounting policy

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred income tax. Income tax expense is recognized in net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in equity or other comprehensive income. Current income tax for current and prior periods is recognized at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date and are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of changes in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment or the substantive enactment date. A deferred income tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilized. Deferred income taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and branches where it is expected that the earnings of the subsidiary or branch will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.

The Company offsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities; deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The income tax provision for the interim period is made based on the best estimate of the annual average tax rate expected to be applicable for the full financial year. Tax benefits of deductions earned on exercise of employee share options in excess of compensation charged to income are credited to equity.

The applicable Indian corporate statutory tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2025 is 25.17% and for the year ended March 31, 2024 is 34.94%. Income tax expense for the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 includes provisions (net of reversals) of ₹97 crore and reversals (net of provisions) of ₹913 crore, respectively. These provisions and reversals pertaining to prior periods are primarily on account of adjudication of certain disputed matters, upon filing of tax return and completion of assessments, across various jurisdictions.

During the year ended March 31, 2025, the Company received orders under Section 250 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, from the Income Tax Authorities in India for the assessment years, 2016-17 and 2019-20. These orders confirmed the Company's position with respect to tax treatment of certain contentious matters. As a result interest income (pre-tax) of ₹327 crore was recognised and provision for income tax aggregating ₹183 crore was reversed with a corresponding credit to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Also, upon resolution of the disputes, an amount aggregating to ₹1,068 crore has been reduced from contingent liabilities.

During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company received orders under Sections 250 and 254 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, from the Income Tax Authorities in India for the assessment years, 2007-08 to 2015-16, 2017-18 and 2018-19. These orders confirmed the Company's position with respect to tax treatment of certain contentious matters. As a result interest income (pre-tax) of ₹1,933 crore was recognised and provision for income tax aggregating ₹525 crore was reversed with a corresponding credit to the Statement of Profit and Loss.

The foreign tax expense is due to income taxes payable overseas, principally in the United States. In India, the Company has benefited from certain income tax incentives that the Government of India had provided for export of software and services from the units registered under the Special Economic Zones Act (SEZs), 2005 in the prior years. SEZ units which began the provision of services on or after April 1, 2005 are eligible for a deduction of 100% of profits or gains derived from the export of services for the first five years from the financial year in which the unit commenced the provision of services and 50% of such profits or gains for further five years. Up to 50% of such profits or gains is also available for a further five years subject to creation of a Special Economic Zone re-investment Reserve out of the profit for the eligible SEZ units and utilization of such reserve by the Company for acquiring new plant and machinery for the purpose of its business as per the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961. (Refer to Special Economic Zone Re-investment reserve under Note 2.12 Equity).

Deferred income tax for the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 substantially relates to origination and reversal of temporary differences. Infosys is subject to a 15% Branch Profit Tax (BPT) in the US to the extent its US branch's net profit during the year is greater than the increase in the net assets of the US branch during the year, computed in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code. As at March 31, 2025, Infosys' US branch net assets amounted to approximately ₹7,755 crore. As at March 31, 2025, the Company has a deferred tax liability for branch profit tax of ₹271 crore (net of credits), as the Company estimates that these branch profits are expected to be distributed in the foreseeable future.

Deferred income tax liabilities have not been recognized on temporary differences amounting to ₹16,593 crore and ₹10,776 crore as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively, associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches as the Company is able to control the timing of reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The Company majorly intends to repatriate earnings from subsidiaries and branches only to the extent these can be distributed in a tax-free manner.

Deferred income tax assets have not been recognized on accumulated losses of ₹1,466 crore and ₹1,358 crore as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively as it is probable that future taxable profit will not be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilized in the foreseeable future. Majority of the accumulated losses as at March 31, 2025 will expire between financial years 2028 to 2030.

# Accounting policy

In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, the Management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. The Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, management believes that the Company will realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced.

The Company’s Advanced Pricing Arrangement (APA) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for US branch income tax expired in March 2021. The Company has applied for renewal of APA and currently the US taxable income is based on the Company’s best estimate determined based on the expected value method.

The Company derives revenues primarily from IT services comprising software development and related services, cloud and infrastructure services, maintenance, consulting and package implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Company’s core and digital offerings (together called as “software-related services”). Contracts with customers are either on a time-and-material, unit of work, fixed-price or on a fixed-timeframe basis.

Revenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition and measurement when the contract has been approved in writing, by the parties, to the contract, the parties to contract are committed to perform their respective obligations under the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services (“performance obligations”) to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company has received or expects to receive in exchange for these products or services (“transaction price”). When there is uncertainty as to collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.

The Company assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In the absence of such evidence, the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin, under which the Company estimates the cost of satisfying the performance obligation and then adds an appropriate margin based on similar services.



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2024-25

The Company’s contracts may include variable consideration including rebates, volume discounts and penalties. The Company includes variable consideration as part of transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the variable consideration and when it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.

Revenue on time-and-material and unit of work based contracts, are recognized as the related services are performed. Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or ratably using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and Company’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.

Efforts or costs expended are used to determine progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. Progress towards completion is measured as the ratio of costs or efforts incurred to date (representing work performed) to the estimated total costs or efforts. Estimates of transaction price and total costs or efforts are continuously monitored over the term of the contracts and are recognized in net profit in the period when these estimates change or when the estimates are revised. Revenues and the estimated total costs or efforts are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.

The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance-based billing and / or milestone based progress billings. Revenues in excess of billing are classified as unbilled revenue while billing in excess of revenues are classified as contract liabilities (which we refer to as "unearned revenues").

In arrangements for software development and related services and maintenance services, by applying the revenue recognition criteria for each distinct performance obligation, the arrangements with customers generally meet the criteria for considering software development and related services as distinct performance obligations. For allocating the transaction price, the Company measures the revenue in respect of each performance obligation of a contract at its relative standalone selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In cases where the Company is unable to determine the standalone selling price, the Company uses the expected cost plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. For software development and related services, the performance obligations are satisfied as and when the services are rendered since the customer generally obtains control of the work as it progresses.

Certain cloud and infrastructure services contracts include multiple elements which may be subject to other specific accounting guidance, such as leasing guidance. These contracts are accounted in accordance with such specific accounting guidance. In such arrangements where the Company is able to determine that hardware and services are distinct performance obligations, it allocates the consideration to these performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. In the absence of standalone selling price, the Company uses the expected cost-plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. When such arrangements are considered as a single performance obligation, revenue is recognized over the period and measure of progress is determined based on promise in the contract.

Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a “right to use” the licenses is recognized at the time the license is made available to the customer. Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a “right to access” is recognized over the access period.

Arrangements to deliver software products generally have three elements: license, implementation and Annual Technical Services (ATS). When implementation services are provided in conjunction with the licensing arrangement and the license and implementation have been identified as two distinct separate performance obligations, the transaction price for such contracts are allocated to each performance obligation of the contract based on their relative standalone selling prices. In the absence of standalone selling price for implementation, the Company uses the expected cost plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. Where the license is required to be substantially customized as part of the implementation service the entire arrangement fee for license and implementation is considered to be a single performance obligation and the revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method as the implementation is performed. Revenue from client training, support and other services arising due to the sale of software products is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied. ATS revenue is recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the period in which the services are rendered.

Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Company is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Company first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer. The Company considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or services, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the specified goods or services and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.

A contract modification is a change in the scope or price or both of a contract that is approved by the parties to the contract. A contract modification that results in the addition of distinct performance obligations are accounted for either as a separate contract if the additional services are priced at the standalone selling price or as a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract if they are not priced at the standalone selling price. If the modification does not result in a distinct

performance obligation, it is accounted for as part of the existing contract on a cumulative catch-up basis. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract (i.e., costs that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained) are recognized as an asset if the Company expects to recover them. Certain eligible, nonrecurring costs (e.g. set-up or transition or transformation costs) that do not represent a separate performance obligation are recognized as an asset when such costs (a) relate directly to the contract; (b) generate or enhance resources of the Company that will be used in satisfying the performance obligation in the future; and (c) are expected to be recovered.

Capitalized contract costs relating to upfront payments to customers are amortized to revenue and other capitalized costs are amortized to expenses over the respective contract life on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods or services to customer to which the asset relates. Capitalized costs are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when present value of projected remaining operating cash flows is not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the capitalized costs.

The Company presents revenues net of indirect taxes in its Statement of Profit and Loss.

# Revenue from operations for the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 is as follows:

excess of billings from time and material contracts and fixed-price maintenance contracts are classified as financial asset when the right to consideration is unconditional and is due only after a passage of time. Invoicing to the clients for other fixed-price contracts is based on milestones as defined in the contract and therefore the timing of revenue recognition is different from the timing of invoicing to the customers. Therefore unbilled revenues for other fixed-price contracts (contract asset) are classified as non-financial asset because the right to consideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones. Invoicing in excess of earnings are classified as unearned revenue. Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of impairment in the Balance Sheet.

During the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, the Company recognized revenue of ₹4,404 crore and ₹4,189 crore arising from opening unearned revenue as of April 1, 2024 and April 1, 2023 respectively.

During the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, ₹4,448 crore and ₹6,396 crore of unbilled revenue pertaining to other fixed-price and fixed-timeframe contracts as of April 1, 2024 and April 1, 2023, respectively has been reclassified to trade receivables upon billing to customers on completion of milestones.

# Remaining performance obligation disclosure

| Particulars                         | Year ended March 31, 2025 | Year ended March 31, 2024 |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |

The remaining performance obligation disclosure provides the aggregate amount of the transaction price yet to be recognized as at the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to when the Company expects to recognize these amounts in revenue. Applying the practical expedient as given in Ind AS 115, the Company has not disclosed the remaining performance obligation related disclosures for contracts where the revenue recognized corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity's performance completed to date, typically those contracts where invoicing is on time-and-material and unit of work-based contracts. Remaining performance obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustment for revenue that has not materialized and adjustments for currency fluctuations.

The percentage of revenue from fixed-price contracts for the Year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 is 58% and 56%, respectively.

# 2.21 Employee benefits

# Accounting policy

# 2.21.1 Gratuity and pensions

The Company provides for gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan ("the Gratuity Plan") covering eligible Indian employees of Infosys. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee's salary and the tenure of employment with the Company. The Company contributes Gratuity liabilities to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust ("the Trust"). Trustees administer contributions made to the Trusts and contributions are invested in a scheme with the Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law.

The Company operates defined benefit pension plan in certain overseas jurisdictions, in accordance with the local laws.

These plans are managed by third-party fund managers. The plans provide for periodic payouts after retirement and / or a lumpsum payment as set out in rules of each fund and includes death and disability benefits. The defined benefit plans require contributions which are based on a percentage of salary that varies depending on the age of the respective employees. Liabilities with regard to these defined benefit plans are determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an external actuary, at each Balance Sheet date using the projected unit credit method. These defined benefit plans expose the Company to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest rate risk and market risk.

The Company recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit plan in its Balance Sheet as an asset or liability. Gains and losses through re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability / (asset) are recognized in other comprehensive income and are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. The actual return of the portfolio of plan assets, in excess of the yields computed by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation is recognized in other comprehensive income. The effect of any plan amendments is recognized in net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

# 2.21.2 Provident fund

Eligible employees of Infosys receive benefits from a provident fund, which is a defined benefit plan. Both the eligible employee and the Company make monthly contributions to the provident fund plan equal to a specified percentage of the covered employee's salary. The Company contributes a portion to the Infosys Limited Employees' Provident Fund Trust. The trust invests in specific designated instruments as permitted by Indian law. The remaining portion is contributed to the government administered pension fund. The rate at which the annual interest is payable to the beneficiaries by the trust is being administered by the Government of India. The Company has an obligation to make good the shortfall, if any, between the return from the investments of the Trust and the notified interest rate.

# 2.21.3 Superannuation

Certain employees of Infosys are participants in a defined contribution plan. The Company has no further obligations to the Plan beyond its monthly contributions which are periodically contributed to a trust fund, the corpus of which is invested with the Life Insurance Corporation of India.

# 2.21.4 Compensated absences

The Company has a policy on compensated absences which are both accumulating and non-accumulating in nature. The expected cost of accumulating compensated absences is determined by actuarial valuation performed by an external actuary at each Balance Sheet date using projected unit credit method on the additional amount expected to be paid / availed as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the Balance Sheet date. Expense on non-accumulating compensated absences is recognized in the period in which the absences occur.

(1) For domestic defined benefit plan in India, the market for high quality corporate bonds being not developed, the yield of government bonds is considered as the discount rate. For most of our overseas defined benefit plan, given that the market for high quality corporate bonds is not developed, the Government bond rate adjusted for corporate spreads is used.

(2) The average rate of increase in compensation levels is determined by the Company, considering factors such as, the Company’s past compensation revision trends, inflation in respective markets and management’s estimate of future salary increases.

(3) Attrition rate considered is the Management’s estimate based on the past long-term trend of employee turnover in the Company. The tenure has been considered taking into account the past long-term trend of employees' average remaining service life which reflects the average estimated term of post-employment benefit obligation.

# The weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 are as follows:

| Particulars                                              | Gratuity                  |                           | Pension                   |                           |

# For domestic defined benefit plan in India, assumptions regarding future mortality experience

are set in accordance with the published statistics by the Life Insurance Corporation of India. For overseas defined benefit plan, the assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set with regard to the latest statistics in life expectancy, plan experience and other relevant data.

The Company assesses all the above assumptions with its projected long-term plans of growth and prevalent industry standards.

The Company contributes all ascertained liabilities towards gratuity to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust. Trustees administer contributions made to the trust. The plan assets of the overseas defined benefit plan have been primarily invested in insurer managed funds and the asset allocation for plan assets is determined based on the investment criteria prescribed under the relevant regulations applicable to pension funds and the insurer managers. The insurers' investment are diversified and provide for guaranteed interest rates arrangements.

Actual return on assets (including remeasurement) of the gratuity plan for the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 were ₹152 crore and ₹125 crore, respectively and for the pension plan were ₹59 crore and ₹21 crore, respectively.

The contributions for gratuity are invested in a scheme with the Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law. The details of major plan assets into various categories as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 are as follows:

| Particulars               | Pension | As at March 31, |
| ------------------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| Equity                    | 34      | 34              |
| Bonds                     | 30      | 32              |
| Real estate / property    | 26      | 26              |
| Cash and cash equivalents | 1       | 1               |
| Other                     | 9       | 7               |

These defined benefit plans expose the Company to actuarial risk which are set out below:

- Interest rate risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is generally calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to government bond yields and in certain overseas jurisdictions, it is calculated in reference to government bond yield adjusted for a corporate spread. If bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.

# The sensitivity of significant assumptions used for valuation of defined benefit obligation is as follows:

| Impact from                                             | As at March 31, 2025 | Gratuity | Pension |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| 1% point increase / decrease                            | Discount rate        | 122      | 38      |
| Weighted average rate of increase in compensation level | 123                  | 4        |         |

Sensitivity for significant actuarial assumptions is computed by varying one actuarial assumption used for the valuation of defined benefit obligation, keeping all other actuarial assumptions constant. In practice, this is not probable, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.

# Maturity profile of defined benefit obligation:

| Particulars   | Gratuity | Pension |
| ------------- | -------- | ------- |
| Within 1 year | 267      | 46      |
| 1-2 year      | 268      | 49      |
| 2-3 year      | 292      | 50      |
| 3-4 year      | 278      | 54      |
| 4-5 year      | 255      | 50      |
| 5-10 years    | 950      | 222     |

The Company expects to contribute ₹350 crore to gratuity and ₹27 crore to pension during the fiscal 2026.

# c. Provident fund

Infosys has an obligation to fund any shortfall on the yield of the trust’s investments over the administered interest rates on an annual basis. These administered rates are determined annually predominantly considering the social and economic factors.

| --------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------- | ------- |
| Government of India (GOI) bond yield(1) |                 | 6.50%   | 7.00%   |

(1) In India, the market for high quality corporate bonds being not developed, the yield of government bonds is considered as the discount rate. The tenure has been considered taking into account the past long-term trend of employees’ average remaining service life which reflects the average estimated term of the post-employment benefit obligations.

The breakup of the plan assets into various categories as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 is as follows:

| Particulars                                         | As at March 31, 2025 | As at March 31, 2024 |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Central and State government bonds                  | 60                   | 60                   |
| Public sector undertakings and Private sector bonds | 28                   | 30                   |
| Others                                              | 12                   | 10                   |

The asset allocation for plan assets is determined based on the investment criteria prescribed under the relevant regulations. The actuarial valuation of PF liability exposes the Company to interest rate risk. The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a discount rate based on government bonds. If bond yields fall, the defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.

As at March 31, 2025 the defined benefit obligation would be affected by approximately ₹129 crore and ₹129 crore on account of a 0.25% increase / decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets.

The Company contributed ₹1158 crore and ₹1,100 crore to the provident fund during the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The same has been recognized in the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss under the head employee benefit expense.

The provident plans are applicable only to employees drawing a salary in Indian rupees.

Employee benefits cost include:

| Particulars                | Year ended March 31, 2025 | Year ended March 31, 2024 |

# 2.22 Earnings per equity share

# Accounting Policy

Basic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per equity share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. The dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the equity shares been actually issued at fair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding equity shares). Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as at the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date. Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently for each period presented.

The number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any share splits and bonus shares issues including for changes effected prior to the approval of the financial statements by the Board of Directors.

The following is the computation of basic earnings per equity share:

| Particulars                                                                            | Year ended March 31, 2025 | Year ended March 31, 2024 |

# 2.23 Contingent liabilities and commitments

# Accounting policy

Contingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity or a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

Independent Auditor’s Report

# To The Members of Infosys Limited

# Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

# Opinion

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of INFOSYS LIMITED (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the “Group”) which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2025, and the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended on that date, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as the “Consolidated Financial Statements”).

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Consolidated Financial Statements, give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2025 and their consolidated profit, their consolidated total comprehensive income, their consolidated changes in equity and their consolidated cash flows for the year ended on that date.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“SAs”) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

# Key Audit Matters

| Sr. No. | Key Audit Matter    |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| 1       | Revenue recognition |

The Group’s contracts with customers include contracts with products and services. The group derives revenues from IT services comprising software development and related services, maintenance, consulting and package implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Group’s core and digital offerings and business process management services. The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables involves significant judgement.

In certain integrated services arrangements, contracts with customers include subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods or services before it is transferred to the customer. The Group considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or services, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the products or service and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.

Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on (1) a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.

As certain contracts with customers involve management’s judgment in (1) identifying distinct performance obligations, (2) determining whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition from these judgments were identified as a key audit matter and required a higher extent of audit effort. Refer Notes 1.5 and 2.18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

# Auditor’s Response

Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following:

Our audit procedures related to the (1) identification of distinct performance obligations, (2) determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method included the following, among others:

- We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the (a) identification of distinct performance obligations, (b) determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (c) determination of whether fixed price maintenance revenue for certain contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method.
- We selected a sample of contracts with customers and performed the following procedures: obligations, (2) determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method included the following, among others:

# Key Audit Matter

| Sr. No. | Key Audit Matter                                                                      |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2       | Revenue recognition - Fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method |

Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either (1) on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.

Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Group to determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.

We identified the estimate of total efforts or costs to complete fixed price contracts measured using the percentage of completion method as a key audit matter as the estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. This estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts or costs incurred to-date and estimates of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations over the term of the contracts.

This required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence and a higher extent of audit effort to evaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts.

Refer Notes 1.5 and 2.18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

# Auditor’s Response

# Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following:

Our audit procedures related to estimates of total expected costs or efforts to complete for fixed-price contracts included the following, among others:

- We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to (1) recording of efforts or costs incurred and estimation of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations and (2) access and application controls pertaining to time recording, allocation and budgeting systems which prevents unauthorised changes to recording of efforts incurred.
- We selected a sample of fixed price contracts with customers measured using the percentage-of-completion method and performed the following:

Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board’s Report including Annexures to Board’s Report, Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report, Corporate Governance and Shareholder’s Information, but does not include the Consolidated Financial Statements, standalone financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation and presentation of these Consolidated Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including Ind AS specified under section 133 of the Act. The respective Boards of Directors/Trustees of the entities included in the Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements by the Directors of the Company, as aforesaid.

In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the respective Boards of Directors/Trustees of the entities included in the Group are responsible for assessing the ability of the respective entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Boards of Directors either intends to liquidate their respective entities or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The respective Boards of Directors/Trustees of the entities included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company and its subsidiary companies which are companies incorporated in India, has adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify.

Annexure “A” To The Independent Auditor’s Report

# Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements under Clause (i) of sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”)

In conjunction with our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 31, 2025, we have audited the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements of INFOSYS LIMITED (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”) and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, as of that date.

# Management’s and Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for Internal Financial Control

The respective Company’s management and Boards of Directors of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the respective Companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.

# Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India.

# Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements

A company's internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

# Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

# Opinion

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements and such internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2025, based on the criteria for internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements established by the respective companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI.

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows

# Accounting policy

Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit for the year is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated. The Group considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash to be cash equivalents.

Overview and notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

# 1. Overview

# 1.1 Company overview

Infosys Limited ("the Company" or Infosys) provides consulting, technology, outsourcing and next-generation digital services, to enable clients to execute strategies for their digital transformation. Infosys' strategic objective is to build a sustainable organization that remains relevant to the agenda of clients, while creating growth opportunities for employees and generating profitable returns for investors. Infosys' strategy is to be a navigator for our clients as they ideate, plan and execute on their journey to a digital future. Infosys together with its subsidiaries and controlled trusts is hereinafter referred to as "the Group".

The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in India and has its registered office at Electronics city, Hosur Road, Bengaluru 560100, Karnataka, India. The Company has its primary listings on the BSE Ltd. and National Stock Exchange of India Limited. The Company’s American Depositary Shares (ADS) representing equity shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The Group's Consolidated financial statements are approved for issue by the Company's Board of Directors on April 17, 2025.

# 1.2 Basis of preparation of financial statements

These Consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (''the Act''), guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) under the historical cost convention on accrual basis except for certain financial instruments which are measured at fair values and defined benefit liability/(asset) which is recognized at the present value of defined benefit obligation less fair value of plan assets. The Ind AS are prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and relevant amendment rules issued thereafter. Accounting policies have been consistently applied except where a newly-issued accounting standard is initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in the accounting policy hitherto in use. The material accounting policy information used in preparation of the audited consolidated financial statements have been discussed in the respective notes. As the year-end figures are taken from the source and rounded to the nearest digits, the figures reported for the previous quarters might not always add up to the year-end figures reported in this statement.

# 1.3 Basis of consolidation

Infosys consolidates entities which it owns or controls. The Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company, its controlled trusts and its subsidiaries. Control exists when the parent has power over the entity, is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns by using its power over the entity. Power is demonstrated through existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant activities, those which significantly affect the entity's returns. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control commences until the date control ceases.

The financial statements of the Group companies are consolidated on a line-by-line basis and intra-group balances and transactions including unrealized gain / loss from such transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. These financial statements are prepared by applying uniform accounting policies in use at the Group. Non-controlling interests which represent part of the net profit or loss and net assets of subsidiaries that are not, directly or indirectly, owned or controlled by the Company, are excluded. Refer to Note 2.25 for the list of subsidiaries and controlled trusts of the Company.

# 1.4 Use of estimates and judgments

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the Management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and assumptions affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. The application of accounting policies that require critical accounting estimates involving complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions in these financial statements have been disclosed in Note 1.5. Accounting estimates could change from period to period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Appropriate changes in estimates are made as the Management becomes aware of changes in circumstances surrounding the estimates. Changes in estimates and judgements are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which changes are made and, if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

# 1.5 Critical accounting estimates and judgments

a. Revenue recognition

The Group’s contracts with customers include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Revenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition and measurement when the contract has been approved, in writing, by the parties to the contract, the parties to contract are committed to perform their respective obligations under the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables, and allocation of transaction price to these distinct performance obligations involves significant judgment.

# 2. Notes to the Consolidated financial statements

# a. Fixed-price maintenance revenue

Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period. Revenue from fixed-price maintenance contract is recognized ratably using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of the contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables. The Group uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for other fixed-price contracts. Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Group to determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgment and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information.

# b. Income taxes

The Group's two major tax jurisdictions are India and the United States, though the Company also files tax returns in other overseas jurisdictions.

Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions. In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, the Management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, the Management believes that the Group will realize the benefits of those deductible differences for internal management purposes.

# c. Business combinations and intangible assets

Business combinations are accounted for using Ind AS 103, Business Combinations. Ind AS 103 requires us to fair value identifiable intangible assets and contingent consideration to ascertain the net fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. These valuations are conducted by external valuation experts. Estimates are required to be made in determining the value of contingent consideration, value of option arrangements and intangible assets. These measurements are based on information available at the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by the Management (Refer to Notes 2.1 and 2.4.2).

# d. Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment represent a significant proportion of the asset base of the Group. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values of Group's assets are determined by the Management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology (Refer to Note 2.2).

# e. Impairment of Goodwill

Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of a Cash Generating Unit (CGUs) is less than its carrying amount. For the impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or groups of CGUs which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and which represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored. The recoverable amount of CGUs is determined based on higher of value-in-use and fair value less cost to sell. Key assumptions in the cash flow projections are prepared based on current economic conditions and comprises estimated long term growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and estimated operating margins (Refer to Note 2.4.1).

# 2.1 Business combinations

Accounting policy: Business combinations have been accounted for using the acquisition method under the provisions of Ind AS 103, Business Combinations. The purchase price in an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of acquisition, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. The purchase price also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration.

314



# Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination

are measured initially at their fair value on the date of acquisition. Contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

The interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity of subsidiaries.

Business combinations between entities under common control is accounted for at carrying value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Group's consolidated financial statements.

The payments related to options issued by the Group over the non-controlling interests in its subsidiaries are accounted as financial liabilities and initially recognized at the estimated present value of gross obligations. Such options are subsequently measured at fair value in order to reflect the amount payable under the option at the date at which it becomes exercisable. In the event that the option expires unexercised, the liability is derecognized.

The excess of the purchase consideration paid over the fair value of assets acquired has been attributed to goodwill. The primary items that generated this goodwill are the value of the acquired assembled workforce and estimated synergies, neither of which qualify as an intangible asset. Goodwill is not tax-deductible.

The purchase consideration of ₹198 crore includes cash of ₹168 crore and contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of ₹30 crore as on the date of acquisition.

At the acquisition date, the key inputs used in determination of the fair value of contingent consideration are the probabilities assigned towards achievement of financial targets and discount rate of 5.9%. The undiscounted value of contingent consideration as of March 31, 2025 was ₹33 crore.

Additionally, this acquisition has retention bonus and management incentive payable to the employees of the acquiree over three years, subject to their continuous employment with the Group and achievement of financial targets for the respective years. Bonus and incentives are recognized in employee benefit expenses in the Statement of Profit and loss over the period of service.

Fair value of trade receivables acquired is ₹32 crore as of acquisition date and as of March 31, 2025 the amounts are substantially collected.

# Transaction costs

that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination such as finder’s fees, legal fees, due diligence fees, and other professional and consulting fees are expensed as incurred. The transaction costs of ₹2 crore related to the acquisition have been included under administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and loss for the three months ended June 30, 2024.

# 2.2 Property, plant and equipment

# Accounting policy

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Costs directly attributable to acquisition are capitalized until the property, plant and equipment are ready for use, as intended by the Management. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived at after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life.

The Group depreciates property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:

| Buildings(1)              | 22-25 years                                     |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Plant and machinery(1)(2) | 5 years                                         |
| Office equipment          | 5 years                                         |
| Computer equipment(1)     | 3-5 years                                       |
| Furniture and fixtures(1) | 5 years                                         |
| Vehicles(1)               | 5 years                                         |
| Leasehold improvements    | Lower of useful life of the asset or lease term |

(1) Based on technical evaluation, the Management believes that the useful lives as given above best represent the period over which the Management expects to use these assets. Hence, the useful lives for these assets is different from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013.

(2) Includes solar plant with a useful life of 25 years.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The useful lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology.

Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet date is classified as capital advances under other non-current assets and the cost of assets not ready to use before such date are disclosed under 'Capital work-in-progress'. Subsequent expenditures relating to property, plant and equipment is capitalized only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with these will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the financial statements upon sale or retirement of the asset.

# Proposed acquisitions

On April 17, 2025, Infosys Singapore Pte Ltd., a wholly-owned step down subsidiary of Infosys Limited, entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the equity share capital of The Missing Link, a leading Cybersecurity service provider headquartered in Australia, for a consideration including earn-outs amounting up to AUD 98 million (approximately ₹527 crore), excluding management incentives, and retention bonus, subject to customary closing adjustments.

On April 17, 2025, Infosys Nova Holdings LLC, a wholly-owned step down subsidiary of Infosys Limited, entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the partnership interests of MRE Consulting Ltd, a leading Energy Consulting company, headquartered in USA, for a consideration including earn-outs amounting up to $36 million (approximately ₹308 crore).

# Impairment

Property, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other.



assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. An impairment loss is reversed in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of any accumulated depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.

# 2.4 Goodwill and other intangible assets

# 2.4.1 Goodwill

# Accounting policy

Goodwill represents the purchase consideration in excess of the Group's interest in the net fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity. When the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired exceeds purchase consideration, the fair value of net assets acquired is reassessed and the bargain purchase gain is recognized in capital reserve. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

# Impairment

Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of a Cash Generating Unit (CGU) is less than its carrying amount. For the impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or groups of CGUs which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and which represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets. Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of a CGU including the goodwill, exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. Value-in-use is the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from the CGU. Key assumptions in the cash flow projections are prepared based on current economic conditions and includes estimated long term growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and estimated operating margins.

# A summary of changes in the carrying amount of goodwill

is as follows:

| Particulars                                  | As at March 31, 2025 | As at March 31, 2024 |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Carrying value at the beginning              | 7,303                | 7,248                |
| Goodwill on acquisitions (Refer to Note 2.1) | 2,593                | –                    |
| Translation differences                      | 210                  | 55                   |
| Carrying value at the end                    | 10,106               | 7,303                |

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the CGU or groups of CGUs, which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. The Group internally reviews the goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level, after allocation of the goodwill to CGUs or groups of CGUs.

# The allocation of goodwill to operating segments as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 is as follows:

The above discount rate is based on the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of the Company. As at March 31, 2025, the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU exceeded its carrying amount. Reasonable sensitivities in key assumptions is unlikely to cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount of the cash generating units.

# 2.4.2 Intangible Assets

# Accounting policy

Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Intangible assets are amortized over their respective individual estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset is based on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, and known technological advances) and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed periodically including at each financial year end.

Research costs are expensed as incurred. Software product development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and commercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future economic benefits are probable, the Group has an intention and ability to complete and use or sell the software and the costs can be measured reliably. The costs which can be capitalized include the cost of material, direct labor, overhead costs that are directly attributable to prepare the asset for its intended use.

Intangible assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs.

The goodwill pertaining to Panaya amounting to ₹996 crore and ₹972 crore as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively is tested for impairment at the entity level.

If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. An impairment loss is reversed in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of any accumulated amortization) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.

#     During the quarter ended March 31, 2025, a decline in the revenue estimates led to the carrying value of the customer related intangibles assets recognized
      on business combination exceeding the estimated recoverable amount. Consequently, the Company has recognized ₹188 crore as the excess of carrying value
      over the estimated recoverable value for the quarter ended March 31, 2025.

# (iii) Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above categories is subsequently fair valued through profit or loss.

# (iv) Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method, except for contingent consideration and financial liability under option arrangements recognized in a business combination which is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.

# b. Derivative financial instruments

The Group holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for such contracts is generally a bank.

Withholding taxes and others primarily consist of input tax credits and VAT recoverable from tax authorities.

# 2.11 Financial instruments

# Accounting policy

# 2.11.1 Initial recognition

The Group recognizes financial assets and financial liabilities when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities, which are not at fair value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial recognition. Regular way purchase and sale of financial assets are accounted for at trade date.

# 2.11.2 Subsequent measurement

# a. Non-derivative financial instruments

# (i) Financial assets carried at amortized cost

A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortized cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

# (ii) Financial assets carried at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

A financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The Group has made an irrevocable election for certain investments which are classified as equity instruments to present the subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income based on its business model.

327



The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in the cash flow hedging reserve is transferred to the net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss upon the occurrence of the related forecasted transaction. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified to net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

# 2.11.3 Derecognition of financial instruments

The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109. A financial liability (or a part of a financial liability) is derecognized from the Group's Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.

# 2.11.4 Fair value of financial instruments

In determining the fair value of its financial instruments, the Group uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each reporting date. The methods used to determine fair value include discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing model, market multiples, available quoted market prices and dealer quotes. All methods of assessing fair value result in general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized.

Refer to table 'Financial instruments by category' below for the disclosure on carrying value and fair value of financial assets and liabilities. For financial assets and liabilities maturing within one year from the Balance Sheet date and which are not carried at fair value, the carrying amounts approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

# 2.11.5 Impairment

The Group recognizes loss allowances using the expected credit loss (ECL) model for the financial assets and unbilled revenue which are not fair valued through profit or loss. Loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues with no significant financing component is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, ECLs are measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition in which case those are measured at lifetime ECL.

The Group determines the allowance for credit losses based on historical loss experience adjusted to reflect current and estimated future economic conditions. The Group considers current and anticipated future economic conditions relating to industries the Group deals with and the countries where it operates.

The amount of ECL (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date to the amount that is required to be recorded is recognized as an impairment loss or gain in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

# Financial instruments by category

# Fair value hierarchy

Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

Level 3 – Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

# The fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as at March 31, 2025 is as follows:

During the year ended March 31, 2024, government securities, non convertible debentures and tax-free bonds of ₹2,143 crore was transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 of fair value hierarchy, since these were valued based on quoted price. Further, government securities of ₹73 crore were transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 of fair value hierarchy, since these were valued based on market observable inputs.

These investments primarily include investment in liquid mutual fund units, target maturity fund units, tax-free bonds, certificates of deposit, commercial papers, treasury bills, government securities, non-convertible debentures, quoted bonds issued by government and quasi-government organizations. The Group invests after considering counterparty risks based on multiple criteria including Tier I capital, Capital Adequacy Ratio, Credit Rating, Profitability, NPA levels and Deposit base of banks and financial institutions. These risks are monitored regularly as per the Group's risk management program.

# Financial Risk Management

# Financial Risk Factors

The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's primary focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimize potential adverse effects on its financial performance. The primary market risk to the Group is foreign exchange risk. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate foreign exchange related risk exposures. The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristic of each customer and the concentration of risk from the top few customers.

331


# Market risk

The Group operates internationally and a major portion of the business is transacted in several currencies and consequently the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its sales and services in the United States and elsewhere, and purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. The Group holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The Group is also exposed to foreign exchange risk arising on intercompany transactions in foreign currencies. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the results of the Group’s operations are adversely affected as the rupee appreciates/depreciates against these currencies.

During the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, the Group has designated certain foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecast cash transactions. The related hedge transactions for balance in cash flow hedges as of March 31, 2025 are expected to occur and will be reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss within three months.

The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of its forecasted cash flows. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument, including whether the hedging instrument is expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items.

If the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal but the risk management objective remains.




unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced by adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for risk management purposes. Any hedge ineffectiveness is calculated and accounted for in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss at the time of the hedge relationship rebalancing.

As at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, 2,88,384 and 2,91,795
cash settled options were outstanding respectively. The carrying
value of liability towards cash settled share based payments
was ₹18 crore and ₹13 crore as at March 31, 2025 and March
31, 2024 respectively.
The fair value of the awards are estimated using the Black-Scholes
Model for time and non-market performance-based options and
Monte Carlo simulation model is used for TSR-based options.

The inputs to the model include the share price at date of grant,
exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends, expected
term and the risk free rate of interest. Expected volatility
during the expected term of the options is based on historical
volatility of the observed market prices of the Company's
publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to
the expected term of the options. Expected volatility of the
comparative company have been modelled based on historical
movements in the market prices of their publicly traded equity
shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of
the options. Correlation coefficient is calculated between
each peer entity and the indices as a whole or between each
entity in the peer group.

    The fair value of each equity settled award is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:

# 2.16 Provisions

# Accounting policy

A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that is reasonably estimable, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The Group recognizes a reimbursement asset when, and only when, it is virtually certain that the reimbursement will be received if the Group settles the obligation.

# a. Post-sales client support

The Group provides its clients with a fixed-period post sales support on its fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts. Costs associated with such support services are accrued at the time related revenues are recorded and included in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. The Group estimates such costs based on historical experience and estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis for any material changes in assumptions and likelihood of occurrence.

# b. Onerous contracts

Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations under the contract. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established the Group recognizes any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

# 2.17 Income taxes

# Accounting policy

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred income tax. Income tax expense is recognized in net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in equity or other comprehensive income. Current income tax for current and prior periods is recognized at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date and are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of changes in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is

In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, the management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. The management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, the Management believes that the Group will realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced.

The Company’s Advanced Pricing Arrangement (APA) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for US branch income tax expired in March 2021. The Company has applied for renewal of APA and currently the US taxable income is based on the Company’s best estimate determined based on the expected value method.

# 2.18 Revenue from Operations

# Accounting Policy

The Group derives revenues primarily from IT services comprising software development and related services, cloud and infrastructure services, maintenance, consulting and package implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Group’s core and digital offerings (together called as “software-related services”) and business process management services. Contracts with customers are either on a time-and-material, unit of work, fixed-price or on a fixed-timeframe basis. Revenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition and measurement when the contract has been approved in writing by the parties, to the contract, the parties to contract are committed to perform their respective obligations under the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable.

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services (“performance obligations”) to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Group has received or expects to receive in exchange for these products or services (“transaction price”). When there is uncertainty as to collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.

The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. The Group allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation and includes variable consideration as part of transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the variable consideration and when it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.

Revenue on time-and-material and unit of work based contracts, are recognized as the related services are performed. Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or ratably using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method. Efforts or costs expended are used to determine progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. Progress towards completion is measured as the ratio of costs or efforts incurred to date (representing work performed) to the estimated total costs or efforts. Estimates of transaction price and total costs or efforts are continuously monitored over the term of the contracts and are recognized in net profit in the period when these estimates change or when the estimates are revised. Revenues and the estimated total costs or efforts are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.

The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance based billing and / or milestone based progress billings. Revenues in excess of billing are classified as unbilled revenue while billing in excess of revenues are classified as contract liabilities (which we refer to as unearned revenues).

In arrangements for software development and related services and maintenance services, by applying the revenue recognition criteria for each distinct performance obligation, the arrangements with customers generally meet the criteria for considering software development and related services as distinct performance obligations. For allocating the transaction price, the Group measures the revenue in respect of each performance obligation of a contract at its relative standalone selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In cases where the Group is unable to determine.




# Revenue Recognition

The standalone selling price, the Group uses the expected cost plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. For software development and related services, the performance obligations are satisfied as and when the services are rendered since the customer generally obtains control of the work as it progresses.

Certain cloud and infrastructure services contracts include multiple elements which may be subject to other specific accounting guidance, such as leasing guidance. These contracts are accounted in accordance with such specific accounting guidance. In such arrangements where the Group is able to determine that hardware and services are distinct performance obligations, it allocates the consideration to these performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. In the absence of standalone selling price, the Group uses the expected cost-plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. When such arrangements are considered as a single performance obligation, revenue is recognized over the period and measure of progress is determined based on promise in the contract.

Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a “right to use” the licenses is recognized at the time the license are made available to the customer. Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a “right to access” is recognized over the access period.

Arrangements to deliver software products generally have three elements: license, implementation and Annual Technical Services (ATS). When implementation services are provided in conjunction with the licensing arrangement and the license and implementation have been identified as two distinct separate performance obligations, the transaction price for such contracts are allocated to each performance obligation of the contract based on their relative standalone selling prices. In the absence of standalone selling price for implementation, the Group uses the expected cost plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. Where the license is required to be substantially customized as part of the implementation service the entire arrangement fee for license and implementation is considered to be a single performance obligation and the revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method as the implementation is performed.

Revenue from client training, support and other services arising due to the sale of software products is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied. ATS revenue is recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the period in which the services are rendered.

Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer. The Group considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or services, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the specified goods or services and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.

A contract modification is a change in the scope or price or both of a contract that is approved by the parties to the contract. A contract modification that results in the addition of distinct performance obligations are accounted for either as a separate contract if the additional services are priced at the standalone selling price or as a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract if they are not priced at the standalone selling price. If the modification does not result in a distinct performance obligation, it is accounted for as part of the existing contract on a cumulative catch-up basis.

The incremental costs of obtaining a contract (i.e., costs that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained) are recognized as an asset if the Group expects to recover them.

Certain eligible, nonrecurring costs (e.g. set-up or transition or transformation costs) that do not represent a separate performance obligation are recognized as an asset when such costs (a) relate directly to the contract; (b) generate or enhance resources of the Group that will be used in satisfying the performance obligation in the future; and (c) are expected to be recovered.

Capitalized contract costs relating to upfront payments to customers are amortized to revenue and other capitalized costs are amortized to expenses over the respective contract life on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods or services to customer to which the asset relates. Capitalized costs are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when present value of projected remaining operating cash flows is not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the capitalized costs.

The Group presents revenues net of indirect taxes in its Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

* Geographical revenue is based on the domicile of customer.

The percentage of revenue from fixed-price contracts for the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 is 54% and 53%, respectively.

The remaining performance obligation disclosure provides the aggregate amount of the transaction price yet to be recognized as at the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to when the Group expects to recognize these amounts in revenue. Applying the practical expedient as given in Ind AS 115, the Group has not disclosed the remaining performance obligation related disclosures for contracts where the revenue recognized corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity's performance completed to date, typically those contracts where invoicing is on time and material and unit of work based contracts. Remaining performance obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustment for revenue that has not materialized and adjustments for currency fluctuations.

# Trade Receivables and Contract Balances

The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in receivables, unbilled revenue, and unearned revenue on the Group’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) or upon achievement of contractual milestones.

The Group’s receivables are rights to consideration that are unconditional. Unbilled revenues comprising revenues in excess of billings from time and material contracts and fixed price maintenance contracts are classified as financial asset when the right to consideration is unconditional and is due only after a passage of time. Invoicing to the clients for other fixed-price contracts is based on milestones as defined in the contract and therefore the timing of revenue recognition is different from the timing of invoicing to the customers. Therefore unbilled revenues for other fixed-price contracts (contract asset) are classified as non-financial asset because the right to consideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones. Invoicing in excess of earnings are classified as unearned revenue. Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of impairment in the consolidated Balance Sheet.

During the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, the Company recognized revenue of ₹5,669 crore and ₹5,432 crore arising from opening unearned revenue as of April 1, 2024 and April 1, 2023 respectively.

The aggregate value of performance obligations that are completely or partially unsatisfied as at March 31, 2025, other than those meeting the exclusion criteria mentioned above, is ₹1,04,785 crore. Out of this, the Group expects to recognize revenue of around 50.3% within the next one year and the remaining thereafter. The aggregate value of performance obligations that are completely or partially unsatisfied as at March 31, 2024 is ₹90,658 crore. The contracts can generally be terminated by the customers and typically includes an enforceable termination penalty payable by them. Generally, customers have not terminated contracts without cause.

# 2.21 Leases

# Accounting policy

The Group as a lessee

The Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for land, buildings and computers. The Group assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the group assesses whether: (1) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (2) the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.

At the date of commencement of the lease, the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

As a lessee, the Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. The Group makes an assessment on the expected lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Group considers factors such as any significant leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of the lease and the importance of the underlying asset to Group’s operations taking into account the location of the underlying asset and the availability of suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current economic circumstances.

Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.

The ROU assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

The ROU assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.

The ROU assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of these leases.





are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related ROU asset if the Group changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash flows.

# The Group as a lessor

Leases for which the Group is a lessor is classified as a finance or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases. When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the ROU asset arising from the head lease. For operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

# The changes in the carrying value of right-of-use assets for the year ended March 31, 2025 are as follows:

# Employee Benefits

# Accounting Policy

The Group provides for gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan ("the Gratuity Plan") covering eligible employees majorly of Infosys and its Indian subsidiaries. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount based on the respective employee's salary and the tenure of employment with the Group. The Company contributes Gratuity liabilities to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust ("the Trust"). In case of Infosys BPM and EdgeVerve, contributions are made to the Infosys BPM Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust and EdgeVerve Systems Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust, respectively. Trustees administer contributions made to the Trusts and contributions are invested in a scheme with the Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law.

The Group operates defined benefit pension plan in certain overseas jurisdictions, in accordance with the local laws. These plans are managed by third-party fund managers. The plans provide for periodic payouts after retirement and/or a lumpsum payment as set out in rules of each fund and includes death and disability benefits. The defined benefit plans require contributions which are based on a percentage of salary that varies depending on the age of the respective employees.

The Group does not face a significant liquidity risk with regard to its lease liabilities as the current assets are sufficient to meet the obligations related to lease liabilities as and when they fall due.

Rental expense recorded for short-term leases was ₹85 crore and ₹97 crore for the year ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Leases not yet commenced to which Group is committed is ₹176 crore for a lease term ranging from 3 years to 5 years.

Liabilities with regard to these defined benefit plans are determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an external actuary, at each Balance Sheet date using the projected unit credit method. These defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest rate risk and market risk. The Group recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit plan in its Balance Sheet as an asset or liability. Gains and losses through re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability / (asset) are recognized in other comprehensive income and are

not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. The actual return of the portfolio of plan assets, in excess of the yields computed by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation is recognized in other comprehensive income. The effect of any plan amendments is recognized in net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

# Provident fund

Eligible employees of Infosys receive benefits from a provident fund, which is a defined benefit plan. Both the eligible employee and the Company make monthly contributions to the provident fund plan equal to a specified percentage of the covered employee's salary. The Company contributes a portion to the Infosys Limited Employees' Provident Fund Trust. The trust invests in specific designated instruments as permitted by Indian law. The remaining portion is contributed to the government administered pension fund. The rate at which the annual interest is payable to the beneficiaries by the trust is being administered by the Government of India. The Company has an obligation to make good the shortfall, if any, between the return from the investments of the trust and the notified interest rate.

In respect of Indian subsidiaries, eligible employees receive benefits from a provident fund, which is a defined contribution plan. Both the eligible employee and the respective companies make monthly contributions to this provident fund plan equal to a specified percentage of the covered employee's salary. Amounts collected under the provident fund plan are deposited in a government administered provident fund. The Companies have no further obligation to the plan beyond its monthly contributions.

# Superannuation

Certain employees of Infosys, Infosys BPM and EdgeVerve are participants in a defined contribution plan. The Group has no further obligations to the plan beyond its monthly contributions which are periodically contributed to a trust fund, the corpus of which is invested with the Life Insurance Corporation of India.

# Compensated absences

The Group has a policy on compensated absences which are both accumulating and non-accumulating in nature. The expected cost of accumulating compensated absences is determined by actuarial valuation performed by an external actuary at each Balance Sheet date using projected unit credit method on the additional amount expected to be paid / availed as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the Balance Sheet date. Expense on non-accumulating compensated absences is recognized in the period in which the absences occur.

(1) For domestic defined benefit plan in India, the market for high quality corporate bonds being not developed, the yield of government bonds is considered as the discount rate. For most of our overseas defined benefit plan, given that the market for high quality corporate bonds is not developed, the Government bond rate adjusted for corporate spreads is used.

(2) The average rate of increase in compensation levels is determined by the Company, considering factors such as, the Company’s past compensation revision trends, inflation in respective markets and management’s estimate of future salary increases.

(3) Attrition rate considered is the management’s estimate based on the past long-term trend of employee turnover in the Company. The tenure has been considered taking into account the past long-term trend of employees' average remaining service life which reflects the average estimated term of post-employment benefit obligation.

For domestic defined benefit plan in India, assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set in accordance with the published statistics by the Life Insurance Corporation of India. For overseas defined benefit plan, the assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set with regard to the latest statistics in life expectancy, plan experience and other relevant data.

The Group assesses all of the above assumptions with its projected long-term plans of growth and prevalent industry standards. The Company contributes all ascertained liabilities towards gratuity to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust. In case of Infosys BPM and EdgeVerve, contributions are made to the Infosys BPM Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust and EdgeVerve Systems Limited Employees Gratuity Fund Trust, respectively. Trustees administer contributions made to the trust as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, and contributions for gratuity are invested in a scheme with the Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law.

# 2.23 Earnings per equity share

Accounting policy

Basic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the Group by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the Group by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per equity share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. The dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the equity shares been actually issued at fair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding equity shares). Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as at the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date. Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently for each period presented.

The number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any share splits and bonus shares issues including for changes effected prior to the approval of the financial statements by the Board of Directors.

# 2.24.2 Legal proceedings

McCamish Cybersecurity incident

In November 2023, certain systems of Infosys McCamish Systems LLC (“McCamish”), a subsidiary of Infosys BPM Limited (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Infosys Limited), were encrypted by ransomware, resulting in the non-availability of certain applications and systems. McCamish initiated its incident response and engaged cybersecurity and other specialists to assist in its investigation of and response to the incident and remediation and restoration of impacted applications and systems. By December 31, 2023, McCamish, with external specialists’ assistance, substantially remediated and restored the affected applications and systems. Actions taken by McCamish included investigative analysis conducted by a third-party cybersecurity firm to determine, among other things, whether and the extent to which the Company or customer data was subject to unauthorized access or exfiltration. McCamish also engaged a third-party eDiscovery vendor in assessing the extent and nature of such data. McCamish in coordination with its third-party eDiscovery vendor has identified corporate customers and individuals whose information was subject to unauthorized access and exfiltration. McCamish processes personal data on behalf of its corporate customers.




From March 6, 2024 through July 25, 2024, six actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against McCamish. The actions arise out of the cybersecurity incident at McCamish initially disclosed on November 3, 2023. All six actions have since been consolidated, and the consolidated class action complaint was filed on November 7, 2024, purportedly on behalf of all persons residing in the United States whose personally identifiable information was compromised in the incident, including all who were sent a notice of the incident. On December 20, 2024, the Court granted the parties’ joint motion to stay proceedings pending the parties’ efforts to resolve the lawsuit through mediation.

On March 13, 2025, McCamish and the plaintiffs engaged in mediation, resulting in an in-principle agreement that sets forth the terms of a proposed settlement of the class action lawsuits against McCamish, as well as seven class action lawsuits arising out of the incident that have been filed against McCamish’s customers. Under the settlement terms, McCamish has agreed to pay $17.5 million (approximately ₹150 crore) into a fund to settle these matters. The agreed terms are subject to finalization of the terms of the settlement agreement, and preliminary and final court approval. If approved, the settlement will resolve all allegations made in the class action lawsuits without admission of any liability.

McCamish has recorded an accrual of $17.5 million (approximately ₹150 crore) related to the settlement. McCamish has recognized an insurance reimbursement receivable of $17 million (approximately ₹145 crore) which has been offset against the settlement expense of $17.5 million (approximately ₹150 crore).

# 2.26 Segment reporting

Ind AS 108, Operating segments, establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments and related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The Group's operations predominantly relate to providing end-to-end business solutions to enable clients to enhance business performance. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) evaluates the Group's performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by business segments. Accordingly, information has been presented along business segments. The accounting principles used in the preparation of the financial statements are consistently applied to record revenue and expenditure in individual segments, and are as set out in the accounting policies.

Business segments of the Group are primarily enterprises in Financial Services and Insurance, enterprises in Manufacturing, enterprises in Retail, Consumer Packaged Goods and Logistics, enterprises in the Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services, enterprises in Communication, Telecom OEM and Media, enterprises in Hi-Tech, enterprises in Life Sciences and Healthcare and all other segments. The Financial services reportable segments has been aggregated to include the Financial Services operating segment and Finacle operating segment because of the similarity of the economic characteristics. All other segments represent the operating segments of businesses in India, Japan, China, Infosys Public Services and other enterprises in Public Services.

Revenue and identifiable operating expenses in relation to segments are categorized based on items that are individually identifiable to that segment. Revenue for 'all other segments' represents revenue generated by Infosys Public services and revenue generated from customers located in India, Japan and China and other enterprises in Public services. Allocated expenses of segments include expenses incurred for rendering services from the Group's offshore software development centers and on-site expenses, which are categorized in relation to the associated efforts of the segment. Certain expenses such as depreciation and amortization, which form a significant component of total expenses, are not specifically allocable to specific segments as the underlying assets are used interchangeably.

The Management believes that it is not practical to provide segment disclosures relating to those costs and expenses, and accordingly these expenses are separately disclosed as "unallocated" and adjusted against the total income of the Group. Assets and liabilities used in the Group's business are not identified to any of the reportable segments, as these are used interchangeably between segments. The Management believes that it is currently not practicable to provide segment disclosures relating to total assets and liabilities since a meaningful segregation of the available data is onerous.

Business segment revenue information is collated based on individual customers invoiced or in relation to which the revenue is otherwise recognized. Disclosure of revenue by geographic locations is given in Note 2.18, Revenue from operations.

4. Corporate members intending to authorize their representatives to participate and vote at the meeting are requested to send a certified copy of the Board resolution / authorization letter to the Scrutinizer by email to evoting@infosys.com with a copy marked to evoting@nsdl.com.

5. The register of directors and key managerial personnel (KMP) and their shareholding, maintained under Section 170 of the Act, and the register of contracts or arrangements in which the directors are interested, maintained under Section 189 of the Act, will be available electronically for inspection by the members during the AGM. All documents referred to in the Notice will also be available for electronic inspection without any fee from the date of circulation of this Notice up to the date of AGM, i.e. June 25, 2025. Members seeking to inspect such documents can send an email to investors@infosys.com.

6. Members whose shareholding is in demat mode are requested to notify any change in address or bank account details to their respective depository participant(s) (DP). Members whose shareholding is in physical mode are requested to opt for the Electronic Clearing System (ECS) mode to receive dividend on time in line with the SEBI Circulars from time to time. We urge members to utilize the ECS for receiving dividends. Please refer to point no. 16 for the process to be followed for updating bank account details.

7. Members may note that the Board, at its meeting held on April 17, 2025, has recommended a final dividend of ₹22 per equity share for the financial year ended March 31, 2025. The record date for the purpose of final dividend is May 30, 2025. The final dividend, once approved by the members in the ensuing AGM, will be paid on June 30, 2025, through various modes. To avoid delay in receiving dividend, members are requested to update their KYC with their depositories (where shares are held in dematerialized mode) and with the Company’s Registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA) (where shares are held in physical mode) to receive the dividend directly into their bank account on the payout date.

8. Members may note that the Income-tax Act, 1961, (“the IT Act”) as amended by the Finance Act, 2020, mandates that dividend paid or distributed by a company on or after April 1, 2020 shall be taxable in the hands of members. The Company shall therefore be required to deduct tax at source (TDS) at the time of making the payment of final dividend. To enable us to determine the appropriate TDS rate as applicable, members are requested to submit relevant documents, as specified in the below paragraphs, in accordance with the provisions of the IT Act.

For resident shareholders, taxes shall be deducted at source under Section 194 of the IT Act as follows:

| Members having valid Permanent Account Number (PAN) | 10%\* or as notified by the Government of India (GOI) |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Members not having PAN / valid PAN                  | 20% or as notified by the GOI                         |

* As per Section 139AA of the IT Act, every person who has been allotted a PAN and who is eligible to obtain Aadhaar, shall be required to link the PAN with Aadhaar. In case of failure to comply with this, the PAN allotted shall be deemed to be invalid / inoperative and he shall be liable to all consequences under the IT Act and tax shall be deducted at the higher rates as provided in section 206AA of the IT Act, 1961 i.e., 20% of tax deduction at source. However, no tax shall be deducted on the dividend payable to resident individual shareholders if the total dividend to be received by them during financial year 2025-2026 does not exceed ₹10,000 and also in cases where members provide Form 15G / Form 15H (Form 15H is applicable to resident individual shareholders aged 60 years or more), subject to conditions specified in the IT Act. Resident shareholders may also submit any other document as prescribed under the IT Act to claim a lower / nil withholding of tax. PAN is mandatory for members providing Form 15G / 15H or any other document as mentioned above.

For non-resident shareholders, taxes are required to be withheld in accordance with the provisions of Section 195 and other applicable sections of the IT Act, at the rates in force. The withholding tax shall be at the rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) or as notified by the GOI on the amount of dividend payable. However, as per Section 90 of the IT Act, non-resident shareholders have the option to be governed by the provisions of the Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA), read with Multilateral Instrument (MLI), between India and the country of tax residence of the shareholders, if they are more beneficial to them. For this purpose, i.e. to avail the benefits under the DTAA read with MLI, non-resident shareholders will have to provide the following:

- Copy of the PAN card allotted by the Indian income tax authorities duly attested by the shareholders or details as prescribed under rule 37BC of the Income-tax Rules, 1962
- Copy of the Tax Residency Certificate for financial year 2025-26 obtained from the revenue or tax authorities of the country of tax residence, duly attested by shareholders / authorized signatory
- Electronic Form 10F as per notification no. 03/2022 dated July 16, 2022 issued by the Central Board of Direct Tax [Notification can be read under notification-no-3-2022-systems.pdf (incometaxindia.gov.in)]. Form 10F can be obtained electronically through the e-filing portal of the income tax website at https://www.incometax.gov.in/iec/foportal.
- Self-declaration by the shareholders of having no permanent establishment in India in accordance with the applicable tax treaty
- Self-declaration of beneficial ownership by the non-resident shareholder
- Any other documents as prescribed under the IT Act for lower withholding of taxes, if applicable, duly attested by the shareholders

In case of Foreign Institutional Investors (FII) / Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPI), tax will be deducted under Section 196D of the IT Act at the rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) or the rate provided in relevant DTAA, read with MLI, whichever is more beneficial, subject to the submission of the above documents, if applicable.

The aforementioned documents are required to be uploaded on the shareholder portal at https://www.infosys.com/investors/shareholder-services/dividend-tax.html on or before June 6, 2025. Members are requested to visit https://www.infosys.com/.

# Notes

1. In order to leverage efficiencies of scale and optimize the resources available in the group, resources are shared within the group. Accordingly, purchase, sale of services and shared services majorly includes transfer of manpower, sharing of business enabling services like Finance &#x26; Accounting, Legal Support, Purchase &#x26; Facility Management, Human Resource Management Services, Risk Management, Information Security, Management Support, software license and other administrative services.
2. Transactions between the Stater entities in the Netherlands (HypoCasso B.V.; Stater XXL B.V.; Stater Nederland and Stater N.V.) are generally on a cost basis as all these entities are under a tax group and file a single tax return. The transactions between other subsidiaries are either on a cost-sharing or cost-plus-markup basis depending on the respective local regulations on transfer pricing. All transactions are at arm’s length basis.
3. As a part of an ongoing program of entity rationalization, the Company may from time to time propose merger / demerger of entities within the Group. These mergers are generally based on the local regulatory requirements and are accounted for as transactions under common control under the relevant accounting standards.
4. Equity infusion by Stater N.V. is to strengthen subsidiary operational capabilities.
5. Key financial information of each of the subsidiaries is available in annexure 1 to the boards report forming part of this annual report.
6. Percentage is calculated based on the standalone turnover of Stater N.V.

While the liability of Stater Nederland B.V. in connection with any performance-related obligations under the contract is limited to Euro 10 million per year, the said limitation does not apply to certain liabilities in line with the general contracting practice, like fraud, willful misconduct, gross negligence of Stater [or its directors, officers, employees or (sub)contractors] or for personal injury or death or for any indemnities against third-party claim for infringement of Intellectual property including any open source integrated with Infosys solution or for any reasonable legal costs in defending such claim or for any claim by Dutch Tax and Customs Administration or any other tax authority relating to the work carried out by Stater Employees for Customer or for any damage resulting from non-compliance with the Labour Market Fraud (Bogus Schemes) Act or for any claim by the subcontractor against the customer in connection with the agreement.
